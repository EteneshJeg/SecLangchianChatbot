I’ve been saying it for years. \\nIt took a global financial meltdown for most to hear it. But this book isn’t about \\nhow or why everything has gone to hell in a handbasket. It’s about why this bad news \\nturns out to be very good news—if you know what to do about it.\\nI learned about business from two people: my father, who was a very well-\\neducated, highly placed government employee, and my best friend’s father, who was \\nan eighth-grade dropout and self-made millionaire. My real father suffered financial \\nproblems his entire life and died with little to show for all the long years of hard \\nwork; my best friend’s dad became one of the richest men in Hawaii. \\nI thought of these two men as my “poor dad” and my “rich dad.” I loved and \\nadmired my real dad very much, and vowed that I would help as many people \\nas possible avoid suffering the kinds of indignities and failures that plagued \\nhis path.\\nAfter I left home, I had all kinds of experiences. I served in the Marines as \\na helicopter pilot in Vietnam. I went to work for Xerox, starting out as their \\nworst salesperson and leaving four years later as their best. After leaving Xerox, \\nI developed several multimillion-dollar international businesses and was able to \\nretire at the age of 47 to pursue my passion—to teach others how to build wealth \\nand live the lives they dream of living, instead of settling for mediocrity and \\nsullen  resignation. \\nIn 1997, I wrote about my experiences in a little book. I must have touched \\na chord with at least a few readers: Rich Dad Poor Dad  shot to the top of the New \\nYork Times  best-seller list and stayed there for more than four years, and has been \\ndescribed as “the best-selling business book of all time.” \\nSince then, I’ve put out a whole series of Rich Dad books , and although each one \\nhas a slightly different focus, they all deliver the exact same message as that first book, \\nand it’s the message at the heart of this book you now hold in your hands:\\nTake responsibility for your finances—or get used to taking orders for the rest  \\nof your life. You’re either a master of money or a slave to it. Your choice.'),\n",

Since then, I’ve been working to help build yours.\\nFor the past ten years, I have devoted my life to finding the most effective and \\npractical ways to help people transform their lives in the 21st century by learning \\nhow to build genuine wealth. Through our Rich Dad  books, my partners and I have \\nwritten about many different types and forms of enterprise and investment. But \\nduring these years of intensive research, I have come across one business model in \\nparticular that I believe holds the greatest promise for the largest number of people \\nto get control of their financial lives, their futures, and their destinies. \\nOne more thing.

The last few years have brought us a steady parade of fear \\nand panic in the headlines, boardrooms, and kitchen tables across America. Globalization, \\noutsourcing, downsizing, foreclosures, subprime mortgages and credit default swaps, ponzi \\nschemes, Wall Street fiascoes, recession … it’s just one piece of bad news after another.\\nDuring the first few months of 2009, U.S. company layoffs reached about a quarter-\\nmillion per month. As I write this in late 2009, unemployment is at 10.2 percent and \\nstill rising, and underemployment (where your job stays in place but your hours and pay \\nare drastically cut back) is even worse. The rampant decline in gainful employment is a \\nravaging epidemic to which few are immune. From executives and middle managers to \\nadministration employees and blue-collar workers, from bankers to retail clerks, all are at \\nrisk. Even the healthcare industry, until recently considered a job-safe zone, is trimming \\naway significant chunks of its workforce.\\nIn the fall of 2008, a lot of people’s retirement portfolios suddenly lost half their \\nvalue—or more. Real estate crashed. What people thought  were their solid, reliable \\nassets turned out to be about as solid as water vapor. Job security is gone, a thing of \\nthe past. In a 2009 USA Today  survey, 60 percent of Americans polled said they see \\ntoday’s economic situation as the biggest crisis in their lifetime.\\nOf course, you already know all this. But here’s what you may not know: None \\nof this is really news . Sure, it took a major economic crisis for people to start waking \\nup to the fact that their livelihoods were at risk. But your income didn’t become at \\nrisk overnight—it was always  at risk.\\nMost of the U.S. population has been living for years on the knife-edge precipice \\nbetween solvency and ruin, relying on the next paycheck or two to meet each In a 2009 USA Today  survey, 60 percent of Americans \\npolled said they see today’s economic situation as the \\nbiggest crisis in their lifetime.'),\n",

That paycheck is called “trading your time for money,” and \\nduring a recession, it is the least reliable source of income there is. Why? Because \\nwhen the number of employed people starts dropping, there is less disposable income \\nin circulation to pay for your time.\\nI Told You So\\nNot to be an I-told-you-so, but … I told you so . \\nI’ve been saying this for years: There is no longer such a thing as a safe and \\nsecure job. Corporate America is a 20th-century dinosaur, trembling on the edge of \\nextinction, and the only way for you to have a genuinely secure future is for you to \\ntake control of that future. \\nHere’s what I wrote in 2001, in a book titled The Business School for People Who \\nLike Helping People :\\nIn my opinion, the United States and many Western nations have a financial \\ndisaster coming, caused by our educational system’s failure to adequately provide a \\nrealistic financial education program for students. \\nThat same year, in an interview for Nightingale-Conant, I said:\\nIf you think mutual funds are going to be there for you, if you want to bet your \\nlife on the ups and downs of the stock market, that’s your retirement you’re betting \\non. What happens if the stock market goes up and then comes crashing down again \\nwhen you’re 85 years old? You have no control. I’m not saying mutual funds are bad. \\nI’m just saying they’re not safe and they’re not smart, and I wouldn’t bet my financial \\nfuture on them. \\nNever before in the history of the world have so many people bet their retirement \\non the stock market. That is insane. Do you think Social Security is going to be there \\nto take care of you? Then you also believe in the Easter Bunny.\\nAnd in an interview I did in March 2005, I said this:\\nThe No. 1 strength of a paper asset is its liquidity—and that is also its No. 1 \\nweakness. We all know there’s going to be another market crash and we’re going to be \\nwiped out again. Why would you do that?\\nSo what just happened? There was another market crash and many people got \\nwiped out again. Why? Because our habits and mindset caught up with us. \\nIn 1971, the American economy went off the gold standard. This happened \\nwithout the approval of Congress, by the way, but the important thing is that it \\nhappened. Why is that significant? Because it cleared the way for us to start printing '),\n",

Over the next three and a half decades, the American middle class exploded. \\nAs the dollar devalued and the on-the-books value of real estate and other assets \\ninflated, ordinary people became millionaires. Suddenly credit was available to \\nanyone, anytime, anywhere, and credit cards began popping up like mushrooms after \\na spring rain.

Savings accounts are smaller, if they exist at all, and family debt is greater. \\nThe number of people living officially below the poverty line is rising rapidly. The \\nnumber of people who are working beyond the age of 65 is increasing. The number \\nof new bankruptcies is going through the roof. And many Americans do not have \\nenough to retire—not even close.\\nHas all this bad news got your attention? Sure it has, and you’re not alone. \\nAmericans everywhere have finally stopped rolling over and hitting the Snooze button. \\nGreat! Now you’re awake to what’s going on, and it isn’t pretty.

For \\nexample, an S may be heard saying words such as, “My commission is 6 percent \\nof the total purchase price.” Or, “I charge $100 an hour.” Or, “My fee is cost plus \\n10 percent.”\\nWhenever I meet someone from the E or S quadrant who is having difficulty \\nmaking the transition to the B quadrant, I usually see a person with great technical \\nor management skills but little leadership ability.

In most cases, if someone in the S quadrant stops working, \\nthe income stops also. Therefore, a question you may want to ask yourself now is, “If I \\nstop working today, how much income continues to come in?” If your income stops in \\nsix months or less, then, chances are, you are in the E or S quadrants.

The investor loves \\nthe idea of his money working instead of him working. \\nInvestors invest in many things.

However, our school systems \\ndo not teach us much about investing. Oh, I know that some schools teach stock \\npicking, but to me, that is not investing; that’s gambling.\\nYears ago, my rich dad pointed out to me that most employees invest in mutual \\nfunds or savings. He also said, “Just because you’re successful in one quadrant, such \\nas the E, S, or B, does not mean you will be successful in the I quadrant. Doctors are \\noften the worst investors.”\\nMy rich dad also pointed out to me that different quadrants invest in different \\nways. For example, a person in the S quadrant might be heard saying, “I don’t \\ninvest in real estate because I don’t want to fix toilets.” A person in the B quadrant \\naddressing the same investment challenge might say, “I want to hire a good property-\\nmanagement company to fix my toilets at night.” In other words, an S quadrant \\ninvestor will think he has to do the property maintenance on his own, and a B \\nquadrant investor will hire another company to do the property maintenance for \\nhim. Different people, different mindsets; different quadrants, different values.\\nBy now, you’ve probably figured out where I’m going with this.

I lasted nine months before \\ndropping out. Needless to say, I did not receive my MBA upon leaving.\\nThese days, business schools often invite me to come speak to their students in \\nclasses on entrepreneurship. I probably don’t need to point out that I sometimes find \\nthis ironic.\\nCommon questions these students ask me are, “How do I find investors?” and \\n“How do I raise capital?” I understand the questions, because they haunted me when \\nI left the security of a traditional job and became an entrepreneur myself. I had no \\nmoney, and no one wanted to invest with me. The big venture-capital firms were \\nnot knocking on my door. \\nSo what do I tell these business-school students? I tell them, “You just do it. You \\ndo it because you have to do it. If you don’t, you are out of business. \\n“Today, even though I have enough money, all I do is raise capital. For an \\nentrepreneur, that is Job No. 1. We raise capital from three groups of people: \\ncustomers, investors, and employees. Your job as an entrepreneur is to get your \\ncustomers to buy your products. If you can get customers to give you money by \\nbuying your products, your investors will give you lots of money. And if you have \\nemployees, your job is to get them to produce and make you at least ten times more \\nmoney than you pay them. If you can’t get your employees to produce at least ten \\ntimes more than you pay them, you’re out of business, and if you’re out of business, \\nyou don’t need to raise any more money.” You do not have to raise the capital to create your \\nbusiness, because that has already been done for you. \\nBut you do have to build your business!'),\n",

This \\ndoesn’t seem to be the answer their instructors are hoping I’ll give, either, because \\nI notice them squirming when I say this stuff. Why? Because while they teach  \\nentrepreneurship, most of them are not themselves entrepreneurs, which is why \\nthey have a steady teaching job with a steady paycheck and are hoping for  tenure. \\nMy point is not that you have to raise money. In fact, in the business model I’m going \\nto share with you in this book, you do not have to raise the capital to create your business, \\nbecause that has already been done for you.

We know the names of the famous \\nentrepreneurs: Richard Branson and Donald Trump, Oprah Winfrey and Steve Jobs, \\nRupert Murdoch and Ted Turner. But most wealthy entrepreneurs are people you \\nand I will never hear of, because they don’t command media attention; they just \\nquietly live rich lives.\\nI often hear people debate the question, “Are entrepreneurs born or can they \\nbe developed?” Some think it takes a special person or a certain magic to be an \\nentrepreneur. To me, being an entrepreneur is not that big a deal; you just do it. \\nLet me give you an example. There’s a teenager in my neighborhood who has a \\nthriving baby-sitting business and hires her junior-high classmates to work for her. \\nShe is an entrepreneur. Another young boy has a handyman business after school. \\nHe is an entrepreneur. Most kids have no fear, while for most adults, that’s all they \\ndo have. \\nToday, there are millions of people who dream of quitting their jobs and \\nbecoming entrepreneurs, running their own businesses. The problem is, for most \\npeople, their dream is just a dream. So the question is, why do so many fail to go for \\ntheir dream of becoming an entrepreneur? \\nI have a friend who is a brilliant hairstylist. When it comes to making women \\nlook beautiful, he is a magician. For years, he’s talked about opening his own salon. \\nHe has big plans, but sadly, he still remains small, running a single chair in a large \\nsalon, constantly at odds with the owner. \\nAnother friend has a wife who became tired of being a flight attendant. Two \\nyears ago, she quit her job and went to school to become a hairstylist. A month ago, It takes courage to discover, develop and donate  \\nyour genius to the world.  '),\n",

I give her a year and she’s going to fail.” \\nMaybe she will fail: Statistics show that 90 percent of all businesses fail in the \\nfirst five years. On the other hand, maybe she won’t.

The B quadrant is the best place to begin generating genuine wealth, but \\nat the same, there are some barriers to entry that have kept most people out. \\nFor one thing, most people don’t have the cash it takes to start their own \\nbusiness. Today it costs an average of $5 million to start your own business. And for \\nanother thing, building your own business from scratch remains the riskiest of all \\nways to become rich.

When you turn the water on, you have to hold the \\nfaucet there, because when you let go, it bounces back to the off position.\\nMost people’s income source works just like that faucet: You get a little money \\nflowing, and then when you let go, it bounces back to off. You can never build \\nfreedom that way. What you want is a money faucet that you can let go of once \\nyou’ve turned it on, because it stays on by itself.\\nIt’s not just about having income today, tomorrow, and next week; it’s about \\nsecuring your income in perpetuity. This is passive income , also known as residual  \\nincome : income that continues coming in, over and over, long after you finished \\nexpending the effort and capital it took to create the source of the income.\\nShifting yourself into the B quadrant is a strong step in that direction, but not all \\nbusinesses will create passive income. If you own a restaurant, you earn income only \\nwhen you prepare and sell a meal. If your business fixes air conditioners, you earn \\nincome only when you provide that service. Even high-salaried doctors and lawyers \\nearn money only when they see patients or clients. If no patients or clients require \\ntheir knowledge and services in a particular week, the income faucet springs shut \\nagain and there’s no money coming in that week.\\nWhat most people need is an avenue to create passive income. Knowing this, \\nDonald Trump and I teamed up to evaluate the many kinds of business structures \\nthat can create passive income, and published our results in a book, We Want You \\nto Be Rich. \\nAnd by the way, that’s not just a book title. We do want you to be rich. Wealth \\nis not a zero-sum game; it’s not like if you become rich, then you’re taking it away \\nfrom me, or Donald, or anyone else. This is an astonishing and abundant world we \\nlive in, and there is way more than enough energy, material, ingenuity, creativity, and \\nambition to allow every human being  on the planet to be wealthy.\\nSo what did we discover? We found that one business model stood out from the \\nrest. This particular business model creates passive income, but requires relatively \\nlittle cash investment to start up. It has very low overhead, and can be operated on \\na flexible part-time basis until it generates enough cash flow for the entrepreneur to \\ntransition out of his current full-time job. \\nThat business model is called network marketing , and it’s what the rest of this \\nbook is all about.'),\n",

I am not a distributor for or owner of a network marketing \\ncompany, have no financial interests in any network marketing company, and do not \\npromote any one specific company. But I have been very much in the business for \\nyears as a champion and advocate of the network marketing business as a whole, and \\nin this chapter I want to tell you why.\\nI first encountered network marketing in 1975, when a friend invited me to a \\npresentation on a new business opportunity. Since I make it a habit to investigate \\nbusiness and investment opportunities, I agreed to go, although I thought it was \\na little strange that the business meeting was at a private home rather than in \\nan office.\\nI listened for three hours while he talked about the value of building your own \\nbusiness instead of working at a job. I agreed with most of the points he made. At \\nthe end of the evening, the friend asked me what I thought about what I’d heard. \\n“It’s interesting,” I replied, “but it’s not for me.” \\nI was already thoroughly involved in the process of building a business. Why \\nwould I need to build a business with other people? And besides, it was network \\nmarketing.  I really had no idea what that meant, but I thought  I knew what it meant, \\nand I was sure it held no value for me.\\nSoon after my first network marketing meeting, the sports wallet business that \\nI had started with two friends boomed. My two years of hard work started paying \\noff. Success, fame, and fortune seemed to pour down upon my two partners and me. \\nWe had pledged we would all be millionaires by the age of 30, and through our hard \\nwork and sacrifice, we had reached our goal. (And this was the 1970s, when a million \\ndollars was actually worth something.) Our company and products were written up \\nin such magazines as Surfer , Runner’s World,  and Gentleman’s Quarterly . We were the \\nhot new thing in the sporting goods world, and business poured in from all over the \\nglobe.

That incredibly \\nsuccessful business failed a few years after it started. It was a humbling experience, \\nand a very positive one, because it caused me to look closer at the world around \\nme and to ask questions. More of what my rich dad had taught me began to sink \\nin, and my perspective grew. It was not long before I had built another successful \\nbusiness, and then another, and then another—and unlike that first business, \\nthese  lasted.\\nDuring those years, I also became powerfully drawn to the idea of not only \\nbecoming rich myself, but also finding ways to help others become rich. I came to \\nrealize that while personal success is fulfilling, it’s much more fulfilling when you can \\nhelp many others create their own success as well.\\nFor the next fifteen years, I kept hearing negative things about network marketing, \\nmostly from people I knew. Eventually, I decided to check it out for  myself. \\nIn the early 1990s, I ran into a friend named Bill who was a retired \\nmultimillionaire. We got talking, and lo and behold, Bill told me that he was \\ninvolved in building a network marketing business! \\nBill is a very sharp, very savvy guy. I knew he had just completed commercial \\nreal estate projects worth over $1 billion. I asked him why on earth he was involved \\nin network marketing. \\n“For years,” he told me, “people have asked me for real estate investment \\ntips. They want to know if they can invest with me. But they can’t, because \\nmost don’t have the $50,000 or $100,000 it takes to get into my level of real \\nestate  investments. \\n“In fact, many of them have absolutely no money at all. Some are two paychecks \\naway from bankruptcy. So they look for these cheap, no-money-down deals that are \\noften very bad investments. In network marketing, I can actually help people make \\nthe kind of money they need to do some serious investing. The more people I help \\ndo that, the more investors I have!\\n“Besides,” he added, “I really love working with people who are hungry to learn \\nand grow. It’s a drag working with people who think they already know it all, which \\nis what often ends up happening in my real estate deals. The people I work with in \\nnetwork marketing are genuinely excited about new ideas.”\\nAfter a few more minutes of conversation, I had to make a dash for the airport, \\nbut over the next few months, we continued our dialogue, and as we did, my respect \\nfor network marketing and what it represented grew.I came to realize that while personal success is fulfilling, \\nit’s much more fulfilling when you can help many others \\ncreate their own success as well.'),\n",

Now, some twenty years later, \\nmy view had completely changed. \\nPeople sometimes ask me, “Why do you recommend network marketing to people \\nas a way they can build wealth, when you did not become rich that way yourself?” \\nActually, it is because  I did not gain my fortune through network marketing that \\nI can be a bit more objective about the industry. I came to appreciate this business \\nas an outsider, and only after I had already built my own wealth and established my \\nown financial freedom. \\nAll the same, if I had to do it all over again today and start from scratch, \\nrather than building an old-style business, I would start out by building a network \\nmarketing business. \\nSo What Exactly Is Network Marketing?\\nI said that I’ve never actually been involved in network marketing as a participant, \\nbut I know someone who has, and I invited him to join me in these pages to share \\nsome of his insights.\\nMy friend John Fleming started out in life as an architect (he once worked \\nfor the legendary Mies van der Rohe), and that’s one of the reasons I admire his \\napproach to network marketing: He brings that same passion for practical design and \\nfunctional construction to this business. He’s a man, in other words, who appreciates \\nthe value of building structures that last.\\nJohn brings to these pages his nearly forty years of experience in network \\nmarketing. He has owned and operated his own company and has held many \\ndifferent executive positions in others, including a fifteen-year tenure at one of the \\nindustry’s largest and most well-respected companies as a regional vice president and \\nthen vice president of sales strategy, training, and development. He has also been \\nactively involved in the industry’s various trade groups; in 1997 the Direct Selling \\nEducation Foundation awarded John with its highest honor, their Circle of Honor \\nAward. Today, John serves as publisher and editor in chief of Direct Selling News , a \\nrespected trade publication serving direct selling and network marketing executives.'),\n",

The basic idea is as simple as it is brilliant: Instead of spending \\ntons of money on all sorts of professional agencies and marketing channels to \\npromote products or services, why not pay the people who love them most to \\njust tell others about them? \\nThat’s exactly what a network marketing company does: They pay a \\nportion of every sales dollar received back out to their field of independent \\nrepresentatives, who typically are also the products’ most committed and \\nenthusiastic consumers.\\nRobert:  Let me play devil’s advocate for a moment. How can that really work? \\nI mean, can a bunch of ordinary people who are not skilled marketers really \\ncompete and generate any serious level of sales?\\nJohn: Actually, that’s the beauty of it. As every marketing professional, \\nHollywood producer, and corporate giant knows, the single most powerful form \\nof promotion in the world is personal word-of-mouth. That’s why television \\ncommercials spend millions to hire actors to talk just like your mom, your spouse, \\nyour best friend, or your kids: They are imitating personal word-of-mouth.\\nIn network marketing, we use the real thing. The real power of the \\nmodel—what you talk about, Robert, as leverage —is that as a representative, you \\naren’t paid commissions only on products used by the people you refer to the \\ncompany, but often on products bought by the people they refer, directly and \\nindirectly, that can really add up.\\nSo, does it work? You know the answer to that one: Direct selling/network \\nmarketing today does well over $110 billion in annual sales globally, which \\nmakes it an economic bloc roughly the size of New Zealand, Pakistan, or the \\nPhilippines. (I often describe this business model with both the terms “direct \\nselling” and “network marketing” because today, most direct selling companies \\nemploy a network marketing focus. However, for the purposes of this book, I \\nwill just use “network marketing” in my references.)\\nOne reason that the total sales from network marketing keeps growing is that \\nit’s a true win-win. The company gets an amazing level of market penetration \\nand customer awareness that would be very tough and very expensive to get with \\ntraditional marketing. And the independent rep has the opportunity to create \\nsome very serious cash flow.\\nHow? By harnessing the power of word-of-mouth—person-to-person \\nrelationships—to build a substantial network that represents the company’s line \\nof products and/or services.\\nRobert, you talk about a B quadrant business being one that has at least \\n500 employees. In network marketing, you don’t hire employees, you sponsor '),\n",

But the same financial \\ndynamic applies: By the time your network of independent representatives grows \\nto be 300, 400, or 500 strong, you’ve got a serious organization that delivers \\nsignificant residual income.\\nWhat Others Say About Network Marketing\\nAs John says, the model is powerful because it works —and we’re not the only \\nones who say so, either.\\nTom Peters, the legendary management expert and author of the classic \\nbest-seller In Search of Excellence , describes network marketing as “the first truly \\nrevolutionary shift in marketing since the advent of ‘modern’ marketing at Procter \\nand Gamble and Harvard Business School over fifty years ago.”\\nThe emerging success of network marketing has been written about in such \\njournals as Forbes,  Fortune , Newsweek , TIME , U.S. News & World Report , USA Today, \\nThe New York Times , and The Wall Street Journal . Fifteen years ago, you couldn’t \\nhave gotten a single one of these journals to give this business the time of day. Now, \\nlook at what a recent issue of Fortune  said about network marketing:\\n“An investor’s dream … the best-kept secret of the business world … an industry \\nwith steady annual growth, healthy cash flows, high return on invested capital, and \\nlong-term prospects for global expansion.”\\nWarren Buffett and Richard Branson couldn’t be more different. Buffett drives \\na pickup and lives in Omaha; Branson flies his own airline and lives on his own \\nisland in the British Virgin Islands. But they have three things in common. They are \\nboth billionaires. They are both extremely practical men. And they have both owned \\nnetwork marketing companies.\\nDoes that tell you something?\\nCitigroup, Jockey, L’Oréal, Mars, Remington, and Unilever: Guess what they \\nall have in common? They’ve all put a toe in the network marketing water—in some \\ncases, right up to their hips.\\nToday, network marketing is recognized by many experts and accomplished \\nbusinesspeople as one of the fastest-growing business models in the world. Today, network marketing is recognized by many \\nexperts and accomplished businesspeople as one of the \\nfastest-growing business models in the world. '),\n",

They \\nare thinking about supplementing or replacing their current E quadrant or S \\nquadrant  income.\\nBut that’s not where the real value of network marketing lies.\\nThe problem with earning income is that it’s an incredibly limited, linear \\nprocess. Work an hour, earn a dollar; work two hours, earn two dollars. It depends \\non you, which means you can never stop. As I said before, it’s a trap. Most people \\ninstinctively sense that, but they assume that the way out of the trap is to earn \\nmore income. But earning more income doesn’t change the basic fact of being \\ntied to your income. In fact, often earning more income only serves to draw the \\nnoose  tighter.\\nThe B and I quadrants are not about earning more income; they’re about \\nowning assets that generate  income. \\nThe Truth About Your House\\nThe things that most people think of as assets are not assets at all; in fact, \\nthey’re  liabilities. \\nWhat defines whether something is an asset or a liability is cash flow, not \\nsome abstraction of value. In other words, is it generating money that goes into '),\n",

Everything will either make \\nyou money or cost you money. If it doesn’t make you money, it’s not an asset, it’s \\na liability.\\nFor years now, people have been using their houses as ATMs, borrowing \\nagainst them to scarf up cash they could use to pay off their credit cards, take \\nvacations, buy that SUV, whatever. Maybe you’ve done this yourself. If you have, \\nthe reason you did is that you bought the conventional line that your house was \\nan asset, and not what it really is: a credit card with shingles and a driveway.\\nLet me explain what an asset is. \\nMost people are so confused about this that they have it backward. They run to \\nthe dictionary and find that an asset is something that’s “worth something.” Well, \\nmaybe. The problem is that tricky word, worth . Let me ask you a question: \\nWhat is your house worth? \\nBefore you answer, let me ask you the same question a different way: \\nHow much income does your house bring you, month in and month out?\\nChances are good your answer is, “Well, none—in fact, I spend a good chunk \\nof change on it every month, in upkeep, repair, and so forth.”\\nExactly. That’s because your house is not an asset; it’s a liability.\\n“But wait a minute,” you say, “my house is worth a couple hundred thousand!”\\nOh, really? When? When you sell it, at some theoretical point in the future? \\nBut then where would you live? Would you take the proceeds of your sale and buy \\nanother house to live in? Of course. So where’s the worth, the actual discretionary \\nincome that you can hold in your hands and use to buy or invest in anything you \\nlike? It isn’t there: There isn’t any. Your house is not an asset; it’s a hole in the ground \\ninto which you pour money.\\nHow to Know Your Asset from a Hole in the Ground\\nForget the dictionary definition for a moment. Let’s talk about the real world. An \\nasset is something that works for you, so you don’t have to work for the rest of your life. \\nMy poor dad always said, “Work for a job.” My rich dad said, “Build assets.” \\nThe powerful thing about living in the B quadrant is that when you build a \\nbusiness, you are building an asset. \\nIn our Rich Dad business, we have offices throughout the world. Whether I’m \\nworking or sleeping or playing golf, the checks come in. That’s passive income: \\nresidual income. While I won’t work hard for a job, I’ll work really hard to build an \\nasset, simply because I think like a rich person, not like a working-class person.\\nBecause owning a business is owning an asset, when you build a network \\nmarketing business, you’re not only learning critical life skills, you’re also building \\na genuine asset for yourself. In a job, you earn income. In network marketing, '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='The Business of the 21st Century\\n41instead of earning income, you build an asset—your business—and t he asset \\ngenerates  income. \\nI only invest in things that make me money. If it makes me money, it’s an asset; \\nif it takes money from me, it’s a liability. I have two Porsches. They’re liabilities. I \\nown them free and clear, but they’re not putting money in my pocket; they’re taking \\nmoney out of my pocket. It’s not rocket science.\\nFor people who understand this, the No. 1 asset is usually a business, and the \\nNo. 2 asset is typically real estate. And even with real estate, you have to understand \\nthe difference between cash flow and capital gain. Most people don’t understand this \\ndistinction. When they invest, they invest for capital gain. They’ll say, “My house \\nwent up in value. My car went up in value.” That’s capital gain, not cash flow. \\nThe purpose of owning real estate is to keep it as an asset, not to sell it for a \\nprofit. If you buy a piece of real estate for $100,000 and then sell it for $200,000, \\nthat’s not an asset; you just generated a $100,000 capital gain. You had to shoot the \\nasset to get that money. You’ve killed the asset. It’s like selling your cow for money. \\nI’d rather own the cow and sell the milk. \\nThis is the biggest problem with having a job: A job is not an asset. You can’t \\nsell it on eBay; you can’t rent it out; you can’t take dividends from it. Why spend \\ndecades, the best years of your life, working away to build something that is not an \\nasset? Or, to put it more accurately, to build someone else’s asset, but not your own?\\nBecause make no mistake about it: When you work at a job, you are building an \\nasset—it’s just not your asset. \\nWe’ve had this idea drilled into us that there is some sort of inherent value in \\nhaving a good job, but there is absolutely no value in it—zero. And to add insult to \\ninjury, the income from your job is then taxed at a higher rate than any other form \\nof income. Talk about the deck being stacked against you! Yet that is the price some \\npeople are willing to pay for the “safety and security” of the E quadrant.\\nNetwork Marketing Is Not About Selling Products \\nor Earning Income!\\nThe biggest popular misconception about network marketing is that it’s a selling  \\nbusiness. But selling is just earning more income. The problem is, if you stop the \\nactivity, the income stops. \\nA salesperson has a job. If you work behind the counter at a department store, \\nyou’re in the E quadrant; if you’re in business for yourself, selling insurance or homes \\nor jewelry, you’re in the S quadrant. But either way, you have a job, and your job \\nis to sell.\\nThat’s not going to build your wealth or your freedom.\\nWhat you want is not another job; you want another address , one over in the \\nB quadrant.\\nJohn:  Robert, that’s exactly right. People often assume that being successful in \\nthis business means being “great at sales.” But the point of network marketing '),\n",

What’s more, I am also a very poor writer; in fact, I \\nfailed writing twice in high school.\\nSo you want to know something ironic? This C student, who failed his writing \\ncourses in school and who to this day is not a very good writer, has had seven books \\non The New York Times  best-seller list. \\nMy point? Good grades aren’t everything. \\nDon’t get me wrong: I’m not putting down education. I believe in education; \\nin fact, I believe in it with a passion. It’s just that the education I believe in most \\nis the education that truly teaches you what you need to learn to be successful in \\nyour  life.\\nWhen I recommend that people build their own network marketing business, \\nthe No. 1 reason I always give is not for the many excellent, even life-changing \\nproducts you might represent. And it’s not for the money you can earn or the \\nfinancial freedom you can create. \\nYes, the products are often excellent. And, yes, I put a great deal of value on \\nits ability to give you a real path to building wealth. But these are not the most \\nimportant benefits you gain from the experience.

It is a very \\nimportant education, especially in today’s world. Personally, I did not do well with \\nthis level of education.

In other words, it \\nprepares you for life in the E and S quadrants. During my youth, the smart kids went \\non to become doctors, lawyers, and accountants. Others went to professional schools \\nthat taught them to become medical assistants, plumbers, builders, electricians, and \\nautomobile mechanics. \\nI didn’t excel here, either. Since I had not done well at scholastic education, I \\nwas not encouraged to become a doctor, lawyer, or accountant. Instead, I became a \\nship’s officer and then a helicopter pilot, flying for the Marine Corps in Vietnam. \\nBy the time I was 23 years old, I had two professions, one as a ship’s officer and the \\nother as a pilot, but I never really used either of them to make money. \\nFinancial education  is where you learn to have money work for you  rather than to \\nhave you work for money . You might think you’d get a financial education in business \\nschool, but by and large, that’s not what happens. What business schools generally do \\nis take the smartest kids and train them to be business executives for the rich. In other \\nwords, they train their students for life in the upper echelon of the E quadrant—but \\nit’s still the E quadrant.\\nAfter I returned from Vietnam, I considered going back to school to get my \\nMBA, but my rich dad talked me out of it. He said, “If you get an MBA from a \\ntraditional school, you are being trained to be an employee of the rich. If you want \\nto be rich yourself, you don’t need more scholastic education, you need a real-world \\nfinancial education.”\\nThe Important Skills\\nBeing an entrepreneur and building a B quadrant business is not easy. In fact, I \\nbelieve building a B quadrant business is one of the toughest challenges a person can \\ntake on. The reason there are so many more people in the E and S quadrants is that \\nthose quadrants are less demanding than the B quadrant. If it were easy, everyone \\nwould be doing it.\\nIf you are going to be successful in business, there are technical skills you need \\nto learn that you probably did not learn in school. \\nFor example, the ability to get organized and set your own agenda. \\nThis is bigger than it might sound. People who enter the arena of network \\nmarketing sometimes experience a type of culture shock, because they are used to \\nbeing told what to do. You may work very, very hard in the E quadrant, yet have \\nabsolutely no experience at setting goals, organizing a plan of action, setting your \\nagenda, managing your time, and executing a clear sequence of productive actions.\\nIt’s shocking how many people do not have these basic skills. Shocking, but not \\nsurprising. After all, in the E quadrant, you really don’t need them. But if you’re \\nentering the B quadrant, they are not an option. They are every bit as important as \\nskills like knowing how to balance a checkbook, write a financial plan, and read an \\nannual report.'),\n",

I learned a lot in those few years—a lot about business, but even \\nmore about myself. \\nAfter the crash, rich dad told me, “Money and success make you arrogant and \\nstupid. Now, with some poverty and humility behind you, you can become a student \\nagain.” He was right. The lessons I learned from the experience proved over time \\nto be priceless. Building and then losing a worldwide business provided me with a \\nreal-world education that ultimately made me rich. Even more important, it was an \\neducation that set me free. And the most important things I learned in the course of \\nthat education were not about business or money—they were about me. \\nLet me ask John a question about this, and if his answer is what I think it’s going \\nto be, you’ll see what I mean.'),\n",

In your experience, what is the No. 1 reason that some \\npeople fail to reach the level of success they hoped for in network marketing?\\nJohn:  Success is defined differently by different people. What may be important \\nfor one person may not be for another. Some people are satisfied with \\nsupplementing their current level of income, while others are truly looking for \\na business opportunity that can be transforming, in terms of income potential \\nand lifestyle goals. You have to define failure in a very broad sense. Being able to \\nearn $1,000 a month may be seen as failure for the person who was attempting \\nto build a significant business, but great success for the mother whose goal was \\nto significantly supplement the household income. \\nRegardless of the goal, we know that those who persist in network marketing \\ntend to get only better and better. In fact, the only way I believe people fail is \\nto quit.\\nBut this needs a little but more detail to be fully accurate. It’s not simply \\na matter of whether or not one quits the company—that is, resigns one’s \\ndistributorship and formally declares, “I’m out.” The issue here is not about \\nquitting the business; it’s about quitting on yourself .\\nThat’s exactly what I thought. It goes back to what I said at the very beginning \\nof this book: This isn’t just about changing the type of business you’re working \\nwith; it’s also about changing you. I can show you the perfect business, but for your \\nbusiness to grow, you will have to grow as well.\\nThe Winner in You—and the Loser in You\\nThere are two words for what John just described. One is quitter ; the other \\nis loser. \\nEach of us has a winner and a loser inside of us. That includes me, too: There’s \\na winner in me and a loser in me, and they often compete for air time. The reason \\nmost people “just get by” instead of truly succeeding in life is that they let the loser \\ninside them dominate. I don’t. I insist that the winner win out.\\nHow do you know when the loser is speaking up? “Oh, I can’t afford that.” “Oh, \\nthat’s too risky.” Or, “What if I fail?” The winner is up for the risk, but the loser \\nthinks only of safety and security. \\nIt’s ironic. The loser yaps and squawks about safety and security—and ends up \\nstuck in a career and a life that is never truly safe or secure. What’s safe about working \\na forty-hour-a-week job for a corporation that will probably lay you off within the \\nnext few years? Or sticking your meager earnings into a 401(k) that gets sucked up \\nby a mutual fund that tanks, or into a fund managed by a financial advisor who turns \\nout to be another Bernie Madoff? \\nInside each of us is the winner and the loser, the rich guy and the poor guy, the \\none who works out and the one who sits on the couch. That’s the battle. The reason '),\n",

Your loser friends want you to stay \\non the couch, they want you to play it safe and work your forty hours, because if you \\ndo, then you won’t be challenging them to do anything different. Not your network \\nmarketing sponsor. Your network marketing team wants to see you excel, to step \\nbeyond what you’re used to doing, to go beyond your history and become the more \\nexceptional, extraordinary you, instead of remaining the ordinary you. \\nIt’s easy to say, “I can’t afford that,” or, “It’s just too expensive,” or, “I just want \\nmy benefits; I don’t want to have to work that hard or take those risks.” That’s the \\nloser speaking.\\nAnd you shouldn’t feel bad about that. We’ve all got one. I have one in me, and \\nlots of times he gets the upper hand—at least for a short time. Every morning, I make \\nthat choice: Who got up this morning, the rich me or the poor me? The winner or \\nthe loser? That’s our battle. \\nIn fact, we each have an entire cast of characters inside us, a whole spectrum \\nof who we could potentially turn out to be. I wanted the person who was happily \\nmarried, who made a contribution to the planet, and who was spiritually inclined \\nfor freedom. \\nEvery time we let our fears, our doubts, or our low self-esteem win, the loser \\nemerges and holds sway. Learning to share your vision and tell a powerful, persuasive \\nstory is learning how to override the loser inside you and allowing the winner to rise \\nto the surface. Learning how to tell a powerful story is learning how to show up as \\nthe winner you are.\\nMost people don’t have the ability to keep going, to handle disappointment \\nand never lose sight of the vision of where they’re going. They simply haven’t been \\ntrained in that skill. But that’s critically important. That’s the real skill of someone \\nwho has mastered the B quadrant. That is thinking like an entrepreneur—and that’s \\nthe single most important attribute you can learn from building your own network \\nmarketing business.\\nIt took me two full years, when I first went to work for Xerox Corporation, to \\nbegin stepping into my power and letting the winner in me emerge. I was on the \\nbrink of being fired at the end of those two years, but fortunately for me, that’s when \\nmy self-confidence finally began to grow. My sales improved, and within another two \\nyears, I was consistently No. 1 or No. 2 in my office. \\nIncreasing my self-esteem was more important than my paycheck. Rebuilding \\nmy self-confidence and my self-esteem has been priceless. And it has helped me \\nearn millions of dollars. For that, I will always be grateful to the Xerox Corporation Network marketing gives you the opportunity to face your \\nfears, deal with them, overcome them, and bring out the \\nwinner that you have living inside you.

It will take years to build up your genuine freedom. We talk a lot about \\nfreedom in this country. But you don’t really have freedom until you have financial  \\nfreedom. And that takes time to create.\\nI was born with nothing, and I made and lost my fortune several times along the \\nway, so I know what it feels like to lose everything: It’s easy, in those difficult times, \\nfor the loser to take over. There will be times when you will feel tested; when your \\nfriends are telling you, “I told you so,” and your family members are whispering to \\nyou, “Don’t you think it’d be better if you just put more energy into your little job \\nand let that network thing go?” \\nI promise you, there will be times when it will be so tempting to let the loser \\nrun the show. Don’t do it. \\nWin!\\nFlight School \\nAll caterpillars make cocoons before becoming butterflies. Flight school was my \\ncocoon. I entered as a college graduate and exited a pilot ready to go to Vietnam. \\nIf I had gone to a civilian flight school, I doubt I would have been ready for war, \\neven though I was a pilot. What we had to learn as military pilots is far different \\nfrom what civilian pilots have to learn. The skills are different, the intensity of \\ntraining is different, and the reality of going to war at the end of the training makes \\nthings  different.\\nIt took me nearly two years to get through basic flight school in Florida. I received \\nmy wings, and then was transferred to advanced flight training at Camp Pendleton, \\nCalifornia. The training there escalated in its intensity: At Camp Pendleton, we were \\ntrained to fight more than to fly. \\nAfter we had finished flight school and became pilots, we had one year to \\nprepare to go to Vietnam. We flew constantly, often under conditions that tested us \\nmentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. \\nAbout eight months into the program at Camp Pendleton, something changed \\ninside me. During one training flight, I finally became a pilot who was ready to \\ngo to war. Up to that point, I was flying mentally, emotionally, and physically. \\nSome people call it “flying mechanically.” On that one training mission, I changed \\nspiritually. The mission was so intense and frightening that, suddenly, all my doubts \\nand fears were forced out of the way, and my human spirit took over. Flying had '),\n",

The aircraft was \\npart of me. I was ready to go to Vietnam. \\nIt was not that I had no fear. I still had the same fears about going to war—the \\nfear of dying or, even worse, of becoming crippled. The difference was that I was now \\nready to go to war. My confidence in myself was greater than the fears. \\nMy process of becoming a businessperson and investor followed much the \\nsame process as becoming a pilot ready to go into battle. It took my failing twice in \\nbusiness before I suddenly found that quality that is often called entrepreneurial spirit . \\nThat is the spirit that keeps me on the B and I side of the cashflow quadrant map, \\nno matter how tough things get. I stay on the B and I side rather than slipping back \\nto the safety and comfort of the E and S side. \\nI would say it took me fifteen years to gain the confidence to feel comfortable in \\nthe B quadrant. You’re luckier than I am: You don’t need to spend that long or go \\nthrough the failures and struggles I did. You can get that same kind of life-changing \\neducation right here in your own flight school: network marketing.\\nHow My Business Skills Changed My Life\\nNow that I’ve talked about military training and learning to fly under battle \\nconditions in the jungles of Vietnam, I want to tell you one more story about the \\nhoning of character—this one not on the battlefield, but in the field of love. \\nIf I had not gone through my own intense form of schooling to learn real-world \\nbusiness skills, I doubt I would have been fortunate enough to marry the woman of \\nmy dreams. But I did—and I did. \\nWhen I first met Kim, I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. \\nI was speechless and completely terrified at the idea of going up to talk with her. \\nHowever, my business training had taught me to overcome my fear of failure and \\nrejection—and that training was about to pay off, big time. Instead of hiding in the \\nback of the room and staring at her from afar, which is exactly what I would have \\ndone years earlier, I walked boldly forward and said, “Hi.” \\nKim turned and flashed her beautiful smile—and I was in love. She was right \\nout of my dreams. But when I asked her out, she said, “No.” \\nAn earlier Robert Kiyosaki might have slunk away and admitted defeat. But I \\nhad been toughened by my business training: I collected my nerve and asked her out \\nagain. Again she said, “No.” Now my self-confidence was bruised and my male ego \\nwas fading, but I asked her out once again—and again the answer was “No.” \\nThis went on for six months. Each time she said, “No,” I went into hiding to \\nlick my wounded ego. I was hurting inside. If I had not learned how to overcome \\nmy own self-doubts, I could never have kept asking for six months—but I did. And \\nfinally, one day, she said, “Yes.” We have been together ever since. \\nI tell this story not just because it’s a warm and fuzzy story of how Robert and \\nKim went a-courting; I tell it because it makes a critical point: This is not just about \\nbusiness and money. This is your life we’re talking about. How you earn your money \\nand build your career is how you earn your destiny and build your legacy.'),\n",

Why? \\nBecause even though they love you, and even though they don’t mean to, the friends \\nyou hang with right now might be holding you down. \\nYou may have heard that your income tends to be about equal to the average \\nincome of your five closest friends. And you’ve no doubt heard the saying, “Birds \\nof a feather flock together.” That also holds true for rich people, poor people, and \\nmiddle-class people. In other words, the rich network with the rich, the poor network \\nwith other poor people, and the middle class hangs out with the middle class. \\nMy rich dad often said, “If you want to become rich, you need to network with \\nthose who are rich or who can help you become rich.” \\nMany people spend their lives hanging out and networking with people who \\nhold them back financially. In a network marketing business, you hang out with \\npeople who are there to help you become richer. Ask yourself this: “Are the people \\nwith whom I spend time dedicated to me becoming rich? Or are they more interested \\nin me continuing on as a hard worker?”\\nBy the age of 15, I knew that I wanted to become financially free, and that one \\nway to do that was to learn how to network with people who could help me become \\nfinancially free. I decided I would seek the friendship of friends who were interested \\nin me becoming a rich person, rather than becoming a loyal employee working for \\nthe rich. \\nThis was a life-changing moment. It was not an easy decision, because at 15, I \\nhad to be very careful about who I spent my time with and which teachers I would \\nlisten to. If you are considering building your own business, you need to be acutely \\naware of who you’re spending your time with and who your teachers are. It’s a \\ncrucial  consideration. \\nThe hardest thing about leaving Xerox was that I had to let go of some \\nfriendships. Most of my friends and family were in the E quadrant, and they had '),\n",

They valued security and a steady paycheck, and I valued \\nfreedom and financial independence. This made my decision a painful experience, \\nbut it was a necessary decision to make if I was going to grow. \\nYou may well experience something similar in network marketing. You may \\nfind that there are friends or family members who don’t understand or sympathize \\nwith your decision to look into network marketing, or who may even actively try to \\ndiscourage you. You may have friends tell you that you’re nuts, you’re a sucker, or \\nyou’re making a huge mistake. You may even lose friends. I hesitate to write that \\nsentence, because it sounds harsh. But that’s because it is harsh. It’s reality.\\nAnd mind you, this has nothing to do with network marketing itself. What’s \\nreally going on here is that you are making a seismic shift in your life, from living in \\nthe E or S quadrant to living in the B quadrant. This is not simply taking a different \\njob; it’s more like moving to a different country, changing your religion, or switching \\npolitical parties.\\n The English poet John Donne wrote, “No man is an island, entire of itself; every \\nman is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.” He said that way back in 1623, \\nand it’s a thousand times truer in the incredibly interconnected world of today. You \\ncan’t get rich in isolation; you are only as good as the community of people you hang \\nout with, talk with, work with, and play with. \\nJohn: That’s true everywhere in life, but it’s especially true and especially \\nrelevant in network marketing, because when you build a network marketing \\nbusiness, you actually build around yourself a powerful, brand-new community \\nof friends who are learning the same kinds of values and real-world business \\nskills you are. \\nThis is also one of the great advantages of a network marketing business: \\nRather than being surrounded by people who are competing with you for \\nthat next promotion, here your business is filled with people who are just as \\ncommitted to your success as you are, because your success is what assures \\ntheir success. Chances are good that some of them will become your new \\nbest friends. \\nIn fact, according to the Direct Selling Association (DSA), a significant \\nnumber of people who join network marketing companies and stick with them \\nrank the social network they belong t o as an even higher priority than the income \\nthey earn. Network marketing not only provides a great business \\neducation, it also provides a whole-new world of \\nfriends—friends who are going in the same direction as \\nyou are and share the same core values as you do.

I remembered that my rich dad really respected this term. \\nThomas Edison was one of my rich dad’s heroes. People today often think of \\nEdison as the inventor of the light bulb, but this is not true. Edison did not invent \\nthe light bulb; what he did do was improve it and perfect it. Even more important, \\nhe figured how to turn it into a business.\\nAfter dropping out of school (because his teachers thought he wasn’t smart \\nenough to succeed there), Edison took a job selling candies and magazines on the \\nrailroads. Soon, he began printing his own newspaper, and within a year, he had \\nhired a team of boys to sell candies along with his newspaper. He had gone from \\nemployee to business owner.\\nYoung Edison grew restless selling newspapers, and learned how to send and \\nreceive Morse code so he could get a job as a telegraph operator. Soon he was one \\nof the best telegraph operators around—and this is where he learned the secret that \\nwould make him a millionaire. As a telegraph operator, he saw what had transformed \\nthe invention of the telegraph into such a success: It was the system of lines, poles, \\nskilled people, and relay stations. It was the power of a network.\\nWhile Edison is famous for tinkering with the light bulb and perfecting the \\nfilament that made the bulb practical, Edison’s true stroke of genius was to create a \\ncompany that strung the electric lines that allowed the light bulb to penetrate society. \\nThe company Edison founded would make him a multimillionaire. It was called \\nGeneral Electric.The power is not in the product; the power is in the \\nnetwork. If you want to become rich, the best strategy is \\nto find a way to build a strong, viable, growing  network.'),\n",

It was \\nthe network . \\nMy rich dad told me, “The richest people in the world build networks. Everyone \\nelse looks for work.”\\nFrom the shipping magnates and railroad barons to Sam Walton, Bill Gates, and \\nJeff Bezos, the great fortunes of the world have been made by those who figured out \\nhow to build networks. Sam Walton didn’t manufacture goods for people; he built \\nthe distribution network that delivers the goods. Bill Gates didn’t build computers; \\nhe built the operating system that ran on those computers. Jeff Bezos didn’t go into \\npublishing books; he created the online network Amazon that delivers those books.\\nThe power is not in the product; the power is in the network. If you want \\nto become rich, the best strategy is to find a way to build a strong, viable, \\ngrowing  network.\\nOf course, most of us are not Thomas Edison, Sam Walton, or Bill Gates, \\nand never will be. Yes, there will be handfuls of remarkably creative pioneers in \\nevery generation who create new multibillion-dollar networks from scratch, as these \\nmen did, but it’s not a reasonable ambition for tens of thousands of people, let \\nalone  millions.\\nThat’s why network marketing is so brilliant. The companies that make up \\nthe network marketing industry now offer millions of people just like yourself the \\nopportunity to build their own network rather than spend their lives working for \\nsomeone else’s network. \\nMetcalfe’s Law\\nRobert Metcalfe, the founder of 3Com and one of the creators of Ethernet, is \\ncredited with creating an equation that defines the value of networks: \\nV = N2\\nIn other words, a network’s economic value equals the number of the network’s \\nusers squared.\\nPutting Metcalfe’s Law in simpler terms, it means that as you add users, its value \\nincreases geometrically.\\nThink of a network of telephones. If you have just one telephone, that single \\ntelephone has no real economic value. (If you’re the only one with a phone, who \\nwould you call?) The moment you add a phone, according to Metcalfe’s Law, the \\neconomic value of the phone network is squared. The economic value of the network \\nwould go from zero to two squared, or four. Add a third phone, and the economic \\nvalue of the network is now nine. In other words, the economic value of a network \\ngoes up exponentially, not numerically.'),\n",

It was \\ncontrolled by a strong central “government” that maintained its strongly centralized \\nidentity no matter how big it grew.\\nIn the 1950s, a new type of business emerged, one that maintained its coherence \\nnot by controlling all its parts with a single central office, but instead by using the \\nmodel of a network. This idea was so revolutionary that many criticized it, and the \\nU.S. Congress came within eleven votes of declaring it illegal. But it survived its early \\nyears, and today is responsible for more than 3 percent of American retail sales and is \\nthriving around the globe. Some of its more famous brands include Ace Hardware, \\nSubway, and, of course, the most famous of them all, McDonald’s.\\nThat radical business model is called a franchise . \\nA franchise is a type of business network in which multiple business owners all \\nwork off the same blueprint. In a very pragmatic sense, you could say they all share \\nthe same values. \\nBut franchising was just one step in the process of developing networks in the \\nbusiness world. I’ll let John tell you what happened next.\\nJohn: Robert’s right. This isn’t just a question of paying a commission \\ndifferently, or shifting the responsibility of marketing to a different party. It’s \\nreally an entirely different way of looking at business—one that reflects an \\nInformation-Age economy through networking rather than an Industrial-Age \\neconomy through centralized mass-advertising. \\nAfter franchising, the next step in the development of networked businesses \\nbegan in the 1960s and really got under way in the 1970s and ’80s. Instead of \\na network of franchised businesses, this model built itself through a network of \\nfranchised individuals . In a sense, you could call this a “personal franchise.” \\nLike the original franchise model, this new type of business also came under \\na lot of criticism; yet, despite its critics, it has survived and thrived. \\nThat model is called network marketing.\\nRobert: And, by the way, the truth about franchising is that as a franchise \\nowner, you are part of a network—but you don’t own the network; you own \\nonly your particular business. As a network marketer, on the other hand … \\nJohn:  As a network marketer, you not only build the network, but you actually \\nown your own network. And, as you put it, Robert, that gives you tremendous \\nfinancial leverage.\\nIn other words, as a network marketer, you get to personally harness the power \\nof Metcalfe’s Law.\\nHow? This doesn’t happen simply by affiliating with a network marketing \\ncompany. That’s like having a telephone when you are the only one with the \\ntelephone.

The moment there \\nare two of you, the economic value of your network is squared . When there are three \\nof you, the economic value of your network goes from four to nine. When the two \\npeople you brought in also develop two more people each, the economic value of \\nyour network begins to look like a rocket taking off for the moon. You are working \\narithmetically, but your economic value is growing exponentially. \\nIn plain language, Metcalfe’s Law means that a network acts as a lever: It allows \\nyou to leverage  your time and effort. \\nArchimedes, the engineer of ancient Greece credited with discovering the \\nprinciple of leverage, declared: “Give me a place to stand on, and I can move \\nthe world.” To demonstrate the virtually limitless power of leverage, he set up an \\nelaborate system of ropes and pulleys, and attached this vast matrix of ropes to an \\nentire fleet of Greek warships. When everything was ready and the crowd watching \\nhim grew silent, Archimedes grabbed this one wooden beam and pulled with all his \\nmight—and the entire fleet of ships began moving in the water!\\nThat’s  the power of a network. \\nThrough that matrix of ropes, Archimedes could perform a feat that would \\nnormally take the combined strength of several thousand oarsmen. And what exactly \\nwas that matrix of ropes? A network .\\nThat’s the phenomenal force that makes rumors spread: One person tells three, \\nwho each tell three, who each tell three, and pretty soon everyone in town knows \\nabout it. That’s how fashion trends spread. And that’s the core strategy of a network \\nmarketing business: harnessing the power of Metcalf’s Law to duplicate your efforts \\nthrough a network of people. \\nNetwork marketing is one of the fastest-growing business models in the world \\ntoday, yet most people still cannot see it. Why not? People might see the product—\\nthe home-care or wellness products, or the telecom, financial, or legal services—but \\nthey don’t realize that that isn’t really the business. The real business is not the \\nproduct, but the networks through which the product travels—not Edison’s light \\nbulb, but his electric grid. \\nPeople still don’t grasp the value of network marketing because it is invisible: It \\nis virtual , not material. You cannot see it with your eyes because there is very little \\nto see.

It is also about caring  about the success of \\nthose you bring into the business.\\nWhich is a good thing, by the way, because only one person in twenty is a \\nnatural-born salesman anyway. \\nThe key to success in sales is what you can do. \\nThe key to success in network marketing is what you can duplicate .\\nRobert: Sometimes when I say that this business is not about sales, I get a \\nskeptical reaction. “Yeah, but aren’t you kind of splitting hairs? I mean, whether \\nyou call it selling  or sharing information , isn’t it pretty much semantics?”\\nJohn: No, it’s not semantics, and you’re not splitting hairs. And it’s that \\nduplication factor that really dramatically shows you the huge difference \\nbetween sales and network marketing. \\nHere’s what I would tell that person:\\n“If you are an amazing, uniquely skilled, superstar salesperson, then you can do \\ngreat in sales—and chances are good, you will do lousy in network  marketing.”'),\n",

Because while you might sell a lot of products, most people in your \\nnetwork won’t be able to duplicate what you do . Consequently, your network \\ncannot grow, and it dies an early death.\\nRobert:  Because you smothered it in the cradle.\\nJohn:  That’s right, and I’ve seen it happen many times. I often watch talented \\nand creative people start out in network marketing and run into this brick wall \\nbecause they think that the way to be successful is to use their ingenuity, talent, \\nand unique skills to be amazing. But it’s not a question of what you can do; it’s \\nwhat you can do and then what others  can do, too. \\nI have also seen companies make the mistake of too strongly recognizing \\nhigh levels of personal sales as opposed to placing more emphasis on showing \\neveryone how to duplicate their efforts in the performance of others. The ability \\nto duplicate is the magic key here, not the ability to be a top salesperson. When \\nnetwork marketing companies fail to make this clear, they impair their ability \\nto continuously develop and energize their growth engine: the people who \\nduplicate themselves.\\nRobert:  That’s fascinating, because when you talk about people who try to be \\ningenious about it, you know what that is? That’s thinking like a person in the \\nS quadrant—not in the B quadrant. When you live in the S quadrant, then, \\nby all means, be brilliant and creative and unique! But in the B quadrant? Kiss \\nof death.\\nHenry Ford did not create an empire and change the face of the planet by \\nbuilding a business model around his workers’ unique skills and talents. \\nNow, he could  have hired craftsmen to hand-make his cars. They would \\nhave been amazing cars—and he would have sold maybe a few hundred of them. \\nInstead, he designed a model where ordinary people could plug in their time and \\neffort and mass-produce millions of cars. \\nFord thought like a person who lived smack in the B quadrant. \\nJohn: I wouldn’t have thought of putting it that way, but that’s exactly what it \\nis. And if you want to be successful in network marketing, that’s how you have \\nto think.\\nAgain, what gives your network marketing business its real power is not \\nwhat you can do; it’s what you can duplicate . In other words, you want to build \\nyour business in a way that virtually anyone else can readily copy. Why? Because \\nothers copying what you do is exactly what you want to happen—what you need \\nto have happen. That’s what creates your success.\\nWe’ll rejoin this discussion of duplication in a moment, but first I want to talk \\na little about that term scalable .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 79}, page_content='The Business of the 21st Century\\n67Information Tools for Infinite Scalability\\nAnother way of saying what John is talking about, when he says the secret is \\nduplication, is this: The power of your business is in its scalability . A business that is \\nscalable  simply means a business that can operate on any scale. \\nThis is often the make-or-break issue with entrepreneurs. The world is full of \\nwould-be entrepreneurs who create businesses that are wonderful, as long as they’re \\noperating on a scale so small that they can personally control every aspect of the \\nbusiness. But there are very few entrepreneurs who grasp how to design their tiny \\nlittle business model so it can be multiplied and replicated many times over without \\ntheir direct participation.\\nThis is the secret of Ray Kroc’s brilliance in creating the McDonald’s \\nphenomenon. He didn’t seek out an elite corps of especially talented restaurateurs \\nwith high-level expertise to run his multiple operations. Instead, he designed the \\nexpertise right into the operation.\\nThat’s exactly what smart network marketing companies have done. Instead of \\ntrying to recruit only the most highly skilled speakers, presenters, and salespeople, \\nthey have designed the presenting into the system itself, in the form of information \\ntools—and as John explains it, that didn’t happen overnight.\\nJohn:  In the early days of network marketing, its practitioners faced a thorny \\nchallenge: While it is true that anyone can learn to give a presentation, it is not true \\nthat just anyone can give an effective  presentation. This meant that, while theoretically \\n“anyone” could be successful in this business, it often wasn’t that way in reality. \\nIn the early days, the business really did rely on people with great \\npresentation skills, and a big part of learning the business was learning how to \\nmake a great presentation. But just as with sales, very few people are ever going \\nto get truly skilled at making a polished, professional presentation. So this put a \\nserious limitation on the business’s ability to grow.\\nRobert:  And that’s where presentation tools come into the picture.\\nJohn:  That’s right. Years ago, people tried to do this with brochures and sales books, \\nand they had a degree of success. While the average person might not be able to \\nbecome a great presenter, he or she could walk a prospect through a brochure or \\ncatalog. But brochures and booklets are simply not engaging enough to capture \\nsomeone’s interest in the way a great live presentation from a dynamic presenter can. \\nOver the past few decades, though, there has been a seismic shift in \\npresentation technology. The explosion of digital technology has leveled the \\nplaying field. Digital tools—CDs, DVDs, and online media—have now made it \\npossible to recreate that fully engaging, dynamic quality of a live presentation. \\nI find it interesting that you’re calling this book The Business of the 21st \\nCentury , Robert, because even though it has been around for decades, in a very \\nreal way, this business model is just now coming into its real potential—and \\nwhat we’re talking about right now is one of the reasons why.'),\n",

In fact, trying to be one can actually \\nwork against you, because again, that’s a highly specialized skill, and therefore \\nnot very duplicable.\\nInstead of attempting to train yourself to become an expert speaker and \\npresenter, you simply use the business tools provided by your company to do the \\npresentations for you.  \\nWhat’s more, these business tools are highly affordable, both because it is \\nin the companies’ interest to make  them affordable, and also because technology \\nhas now made it possible. \\nLow-cost, high-quality CDs, DVDs, and online presentations—often including \\nhigh-quality streaming audio and video—have made possible the dream of a truly \\ndemocratic and fully scalable  network marketing operation, creating a business model \\nthat has allowed millions to gain access and excel.\\nDo you realize what this means? It means that as you build your networking \\nbusiness, you are building a fully scalable asset.

Why does the company even \\nneed you?”\\nJohn:  You network. That’s why it’s called network marketing, and that’s why \\nthe company needs you—and why they pay you. \\nAs a network marketer, your job description, so to speak, is to connect \\nwith people, invite them to experience the products you are excited about and \\ntake a look at the information you have, and then follow up with them. Then, \\nonce they’ve decided to join you in the business, you share with them your \\nenthusiasm, your experiences, and you help them learn to do what you have \\nlearned to do. Here, again, there are digital tools that can take a huge amount of \\nthe burden and expertise of training off your shoulders. \\nYour job is to build relationships, have conversations, explore possibilities, get \\nto know people, and help them get to understand what this business is all  about.\\ninvite present follow up train'),\n",

And there are parts that \\nonly you can uniquely do, and that’s the human connection part.\\nHere is the core idea: In network marketing, you are the messenger, not the  message. \\nGone are the days of carting around a heavy pack of products to sample, setting \\nup an entire retail store in your living room, or having to memorize long lists of \\nproduct features and financial statistics. This is the 21st century . In today’s network \\nmarketing, the tools do all that. Your job is to connect and invite. \\nAnd by the way, this doesn’t mean you don’t need to be skilled. You absolutely \\ndo. You need to develop the skills we looked at as part of Asset #1: the ability to have \\nself-confidence, withstand rejection, communicate, be a great storyteller, care about \\npeople, coach people, and the rest. \\nBut these are skills available to anyone. If you’ve ever helped build a soccer \\nleague, PTA group, or chess club, ever been part of a political campaign or church \\ncommittee, ever coached Little League or formed your own band, then you know \\nwhat it’s like to build a network.\\nYou don’t need highly skilled salespeople to duplicate what you do. You need \\npeople who are willing to learn basic business and communication skills and grow \\nthemselves personally into self-determining entrepreneurs and team-builders.\\nVery few people are truly skilled at sales. But practically anyone can become \\nskilled at networking, coaching, and team-building. Which means this business is \\nopen for business to hundreds of millions of your neighbors. Which means you have \\na readily duplicable, fully scalable business.

To do that required leadership skills on the part of the speaker. The reason \\nit takes leadership is that while many people repeat the same overused words and \\nphrases about dreams , more time with family , and freedom , few people inspire enough \\ntrust and inspiration to cause others to follow those words and phrases.\\nIt’s not a matter of memorizing and repeating the right words; it’s developing the \\nability to speak directly to other people’s spirits. This is a quality that goes beyond \\nwords. This is genuine leadership.\\nYou might think that leadership skills would be included as part of Asset #1, \\n“A Real-World Business Education,” or Asset #2, “A Profitable Path of Personal \\nDevelopment.” That’s reasonable; you could make a case for both. But the truth is, \\nhaving the capacity to lead is a skill set so valuable, so powerful, and so rare that it is \\ngenuinely an asset unto itself, and deserves its own chapter. \\nAll the other business skills are important ingredients.

Kennedy was one of the greatest speakers \\nI have ever heard. When he told the nation in May 1961 that we were going to put a \\nman on the moon within the decade , our scientists really didn’t have a clue how we could \\npossibly accomplish such a thing. It was beyond ambitious; it was outrageous. And yet \\nwe did it. Even though JFK was killed less than three years later, with three-quarters of \\nthe decade left to go, his leadership was so compelling and so powerful that his vision \\npersisted after his death. Despite his assassination, despite the catastrophe of Vietnam, \\ndespite the nation being rocked by riots and division and the presidential mantle passing \\nfrom JFK’s vice president to his former rival Richard Nixon in 1968, what did we do? \\nWe put a man on the moon in 1969—sure enough, within the decade .\\nThat’s leadership: the power to make things happen through the sheer force of \\nthe vision you share. Genuine leaders can move mountains. \\nIn Vietnam, I discovered that great leaders were not tough people who yelled and \\nscreamed or were physically abusive. In the heat of battle, I found that great, brave \\nleaders were often quiet, yet when they spoke, they spoke to our souls and our  spirits. \\nAll great leaders have been master storytellers who were able to communicate the \\nvision in such a vivid way that others saw it, too. Look at Jesus Christ, Buddha, Mother \\nTeresa, Gandhi, Muhammad. They were all great leaders, which means they were \\ngreat storytellers.\\nMoney does not go to the business with the best products or service. Money \\nflows to the business with the best leaders. A business that has forgotten how to tell \\nits own story is soon out of business, even if it has tons of inventory. When I find a \\nbusiness that is struggling financially, it is often because the leader of that business \\ncannot communicate the company’s vision—he or she cannot tell the story. They \\nmay be smart, but they are poor communicators. \\nThe leadership skills you need to develop for the B quadrant are very different \\nfrom the management skills most often required for the E and S quadrants. Don’t get \\nme wrong: Management skills are important, but there is a vast difference between \\nmanagement skills and leadership skills. Managers are not necessarily leaders, and \\nleaders are not necessarily managers.\\nI meet many people in the S quadrant, the specialists or small-business owners, \\nwho would like to expand their businesses but cannot, for one reason: They lack \\nleadership skills. No one wants to follow them. Their employees do not trust them, \\nare not inspired by them. I have met many middle managers who fail to climb the \\ncorporate ladder because they cannot communicate with others. The world is full of \\nlonely people who cannot seem to find the man or woman of their dreams, simply \\nbecause they fail to communicate what a good person they are.Money does not go to the business with the best products or \\nservice. Money flows to the business with the best leaders.'),\n",

Many \\nwere great teachers because they were teaching from experience and not from theory. Sitting \\nthrough many of the business seminars, I often found myself nodding in agreement with \\ntheir straight talk about what it takes to survive on the streets of the real world of business. \\nAfter the seminars, I would often talk to the instructors. I was amazed at how much \\nmoney they made, not only from their businesses, but also from their investments. \\nSeveral made significantly more than many top CEOs in corporate  America. \\nYet, there was something else to these instructors that impressed me even more. \\nAlthough they were rich and certainly did not have to be leading these events, they \\nhad a passion for teaching and helping their fellow human beings. \\nI began to realize that a network marketing business is based on the leaders pulling \\npeople up, while a traditional corporate or government business is based on promoting \\nonly a few and keeping the masses of employees content with a steady paycheck. These \\ninstructors in the network marketing world were not saying, “If you don’t perform, you \\nlose your job.” Instead, they were saying, “Let me help you do better and better. As long \\nas you want to learn, I’ll be here to teach you. We’re on the same team.” \\nA Very Special Type of Leader\\nMany people have leadership qualities within them, but these qualities are never \\nbrought out. They never have the opportunity. My rich dad understood this. One \\nreason he encouraged me to go into the Marine Corps and then on to Vietnam was \\nthat it would develop my leadership skills. \\nBut you don’t need to join the Marines to have the chance for the leader within you \\nto blossom. You can have that chance through network marketing. And the real beauty of \\na network marketing leadership program is not simply the fact that it develops leadership, \\nbut the particular type of leadership it brings out. \\nThe military develops a type of leader who inspires men and women to defend their country. \\nThe world of business develops a type of leader who builds teams to beat the competition. \\nNetwork marketing tends to develop the type of leader who influences others by being a great \\nteacher, teaching others to fulfill their life’s dreams by teaching others to go for their dreams.

Sure, you could learn leadership in any other field. From the \\nmilitary to government to corporate life, every sphere of life produces leaders, but not \\nvery many. Genuine leadership is extremely rare—except in network marketing.\\nJohn has an interesting perspective on why this is so.\\nJohn:  What is unique about network marketing is that it marries a broad \\ncompensation structure to a field of people made up of 100 percent of  volunteers. \\nYou will not find a single network marketing distributor who punches a time \\nclock or has to show up for work. As independent representatives, no one is hired or \\nfired—everyone is there voluntarily. Nobody can tell you what to do; no one can give \\nyou orders. \\nSo why does it work? What’s the engine that drives the machine? The \\nanswer comes in one word: leadership.\\nAnd the leadership you develop in your network marketing business will show \\nup in every other sphere of your life.\\nThe Four Elements of Leadership\\nTraditional schools train you to be a good employee. They focus on one thing \\nonly: your mental ability. If you can solve equations and do well on tests, then you’re \\nconsidered smart enough to run a company.\\nThat’s ridiculous.\\nThe reason I am a successful entrepreneur today is because of the training I \\nreceived in the Marines. Military schools prepare you to be a great leader by focusing \\nnot only on your mind, but also on your emotional, physical, and spiritual abilities. \\nThey teach you how to operate under extreme pressure.\\nI had the smarts to fly a helicopter in Vietnam, but I never would have made it \\nback without the development of my spirituality. If that had not been strong, then \\nfear (emotion) would have set in, and I would very likely have frozen up (physical) \\nat the controls of the gunship. Having these four elements—mental, emotional, \\nphysical, and spiritual—working in harmony helped me make it through my \\nmissions. \\nThis also armed me with the \\nknowledge and understanding \\nit took to be a good leader \\nin the business world, because \\nthese are exactly the same four \\nmental\\nemotional physical\\nspiritual'),\n",

Adams was a Massachusetts barrister from a fairly \\npoor farm family, and lived his long life without ever having much in the way of \\nwealth.

Why no trading \\nof stocks or mutual funds? Because we believed they were very risky investments. In \\nmy opinion, mutual funds are some of the riskiest of all investments.\\nKim and I used a simple four-step plan to retire young and rich. It took us \\nnine years, from 1985 to 1994, starting with nothing and retiring financially free—\\nwithout a single share of stock or mutual funds. It goes like this:\\n1) Build a business\\n2) Reinvest in your business\\n3) Invest in real estate\\n4) Let your assets buy luxuries\\nLet’s look at how this sequence works.\\n1) Build a Business\\nBuilding a business allows you to generate a lot of money. Furthermore, the tax \\nlaws of the United States are very favorable to people who earn their income in the B \\nquadrant and punish people who earn their money in the E quadrant. \\nA business is like a child: It takes time to grow. While it can take less time, \\nand can certainly take more, getting a business off the ground typically takes about \\nfive years. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 91}, page_content='The Business of the 21st Century\\n792) Reinvest in Your Business\\nThe key to this process is that you don’t try to use your business as an income \\nsource to live on. A lot of first-time network marketers make this mistake. As soon \\nas they start seeing an income stream develop from their new business, they use that \\nnew income to expand their living expenses: buy a second car, buy a bigger house, \\ntake expensive vacations, and so forth.\\nWhy do people do this? It’s not because they’re idiots: I’ve seen very intelligent, \\nwell-informed people follow this pattern. They do it for one reason and one reason \\nonly: They are still living, breathing, and thinking in the E quadrant . If you want to \\nbuild wealth, you have to get your head out of the left-hand side of that diagram and \\nstart thinking B and I.\\nFirst, keep your day job. Your goal is not to replace your job with your \\nbusiness—that’s just treating your business like your new job. You’ll never build \\nwealth that way. Instead, once your new business is making some money, go right to \\nStep 2: Reinvest your new income in that business in order to grow it still further. \\n“But I don’t want to keep my day job—I hate working there! Isn’t that the whole \\npoint? I want to stop working as an employee!”\\nFair enough: You want to get out of the E quadrant and quit that job. Maybe \\nyou hate your job. Or you may be like a lot of professionals I’ve met who actually \\nlove what they do, but don’t love the fact that they have to keep doing it forty, fifty \\nor sixty hours a week. Whatever your reasons, here’s the blunt truth: If you suck all \\nthe income out of your new business to burn on monthly living expenses, then you’re \\nnot building a business; you’re just building yourself another job.\\nA true business owner never stops investing and reinvesting to build the business. \\nThe reason so many people fail to achieve great wealth in any business is simply that \\nthey fail to reinvest continually in the business.\\nSo, what does that look like in network marketing? \\nJohn:  A traditional business might reinvest by building a new warehouse, \\nspending money on national advertising, developing new product lines, or \\nbuying new distribution channels. But as a network marketer, you don’t have \\nthese expenses: The network marketing company itself makes these types of \\ninvestments for you.\\nHow do you reinvest in your business, then? There are certainly places \\nwhere you can invest some money wisely: on training and educating yourself, \\non travel to support your growing network in other cities, on promotional and \\neducational tools and resources to help nourish the business. The reason so many people fail to achieve great \\nwealth in any business is simply that they fail to reinvest \\ncontinually in the business.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='CHAPTER  15:  Asset #7:  A Mechanism for Genuine Wealth Creation\\n80For the most part, though, network marketing is a business whose major \\ncapital investment is not your money but your time and effort . \\nWhich means the better part of your networking income becomes available \\nto you to feed the serious process of building your wealth. But notice, I did say \\n“building your wealth,” not “squandering your wealth”!\\nDon’t make the mistake I’ve seen people make, and start spending every last \\ndollar from your new commission checks on a bigger car, bigger house, bigger \\nlifestyle. Don’t abuse your new business income by pouring it into bigger holes in \\nthe ground. \\nTreat it with the respect it deserves. Invest it.\\n3) Invest in Real Estate\\nAs your business income continues to grow, you begin using that supplemental \\nincome to buy real estate. \\nYou’ll notice there are no mutual funds, stock portfolios, or other paper assets in \\nthis plan. That’s because even though they are the easiest assets to build (all you have \\nto do is buy them), trading in stocks and mutual funds is risky, profits made are taxed \\nat the capital gain rate, and investing takes financial education to lessen risk. The idea \\nhere is to use your new supplemental money to build an income-generating asset. \\nThere are many types of assets that can generate income, but the one I recommend \\nmost often is real estate, for two principal reasons. \\nFirst, the tax laws are written in favor of business owners who invest in real estate. \\nSecond, your banker loves to lend you money for real estate. Try asking your \\nbanker for a thirty-year loan at 6.5 percent to buy mutual funds or stocks. They’ll \\nlaugh you out of the bank. \\nPeople often ask me, “How can I buy real estate when I barely earn enough \\nmoney to pay the rent?” Good question; you can’t. Not, that is, until you have the \\nextra cash. That’s why this step comes after building a business and reinvesting in its \\ncontinued growth: so you have the extra cash.\\nBut let me explain what I mean when I say, “Invest in real estate,” because many \\npeople completely misunderstand how real estate works as an asset. Most people \\nthink that the point of real estate is to buy a property at one price and then sell it \\n(either quickly, after some hasty improvements, or at a later time) for a higher price. \\nWrong. That’s just buying a cow and then selling it for steaks. What you want to do \\nis buy a cow and keep it forever so you can sell its milk.\\nThe purpose of buying real estate is not to sell it; the purpose of buying real \\nestate is to build an income-generating asset.\\nLearning how to do this takes time, education, experience, and money. As with \\nlearning anything new, it’s difficult not to make some mistakes—and mistakes in real \\nestate (especially in property management) can be very expensive. Unless you have \\nthe extra steady income and the tax advantages that come with a B quadrant business, \\nreal estate is either too risky or too slow. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='The Business of the 21st Century\\n81The reason many people fail to become rich in real estate is that they don’t \\nhave the cash it takes. The truth is, the best real estate deals are usually expensive. \\nIf you don’t have much money, often the only real estate deals you can get are \\ndeals that people with real money have passed on. The reason so many people \\ntry looking for “no money down” investments is that they have nothing to put \\ndown! Unless you are really experienced and have plenty of cash on hand to use \\nwhen you need it, putting nothing down could be the most expensive investment \\nof your life. \\n4) Let Your Assets Buy Luxuries\\nFor many years, even long after we could have afforded to do more, Kim and I \\ncontinued to live in a small house with a monthly mortgage of about $400 and drove \\naverage cars. Meanwhile, we were using whatever extra cash we generated to build \\nour business and invest in real estate.\\nToday we live in a large home and have six luxury cars between us—but we \\ndidn’t buy that house or those cars. Our assets bought them; we just enjoy them.\\nWhen I say “luxury,” I don’t necessarily mean something extravagant or \\nostentatious. I mean something that you want and enjoy, and that exists beyond \\nwhat you “need.”\\nI’ll give you an example. Think of anyone you know who works for a living but \\ndoes not love their job. If you told them—“Hey, you don’t like your job, you should \\njust quit!”—what would they say?\\nI’d love to—but I don’t have that luxury.\\nThat’s right: For many people, simply not having their job is one of the very first \\nluxuries they want. How do you get that luxury? The same as any other: You let your \\nbusiness and/or your real estate holdings buy it for you. For that to happen, you have \\nto build those assets to the point where they can buy it for you. \\nYou see how it works?\\nYou don’t use your income to buy yourself luxuries: You use your income to \\nbuild your assets—your business and real estate investments—and then, once they’re \\nsufficiently built to be able to do so, you let them buy your luxuries. \\nWhich brings us to the matter of dreams.'),\n",

Notice, I didn’t say “the \\nimportance of having  dreams.” They don’t just want you to have dreams; they want \\nyou to live those dreams. \\nWhat’s more, they encourage you to dream big. One of the most refreshing \\nthings that happened to me when I started looking into network marketing was that \\nI found myself dreaming even bigger dreams than I already had. \\nTraditional businesses are often not too keen on you having big dreams. They \\noperate better if you have modest dreams: a brief summer vacation, maybe a small \\ntime share, a hobby you enjoy, a good game of golf on a Sunday afternoon. That \\nkind of thing.\\nI’m not saying there’s anything wrong with having such small dreams. All I’m \\nsaying is, that’s a small life.\\nGrowing up, I often heard my parents use the phrase, “We can’t afford it.” My \\nrich dad, however, forbade his son and me from saying those words, and insisted \\ninstead that we ask ourselves, “ How can I afford it?” \\nAs small as the difference between those statements may seem, it makes all the \\ndifference. That small shift in thinking, multiplied by the experiences, perceptions, \\nand decisions of a lifetime, will take you to a place that is millions of miles away from \\nwhere you would have landed without that shift. \\nWhen you make a habit of asking yourself, “ How can I afford that?” you train \\nyourself to dream bigger and bigger dreams, and not only to have those dreams but to \\nbelieve that you can make them come true. Saying “I can’t afford that,” on the other \\nhand, snuffs out your dreams like a wet towel on a candle flame. There are already \\nplenty of other people in the world who try to smother your dreams, without you \\nadding your voice to the mix! Oh, they don’t mean to, perhaps, but well-meaning or \\nnot, their words are deadly. '),\n",

Let me tell you why it won’t work.”\\nThese are dream-killing words, and I’ve noticed something interesting about the \\npeople who say them: They are almost always people who have already given up on \\ntheir own dreams.\\nWhen Kim and I were broke, we told each other that when we had made over \\n$1 million, we would buy a big house. We did, and we loved being in the house, but \\nthe house itself was not important to us, and even being able to afford the house was \\nnot important to us.

They may not \\nbe dead, but they are no longer truly alive—and the only way they can come back to \\nlife is to rekindle a dream. \\nThose Who Dream Only Small Dreams \\nSome people limit themselves to dreaming only small dreams, because that’s the \\nonly way they can feel confident they can achieve them. The ironic thing is that, \\nwhile they know they could achieve their small dreams, they often never do. Why \\nnot? Who knows? Perhaps it’s because they know that if they did achieve them, they \\nwould have nothing left to live for—unless they then challenged themselves to come \\nup with larger dreams. \\nIn other words, they would rather live small than face the risks and thrill of living \\nlarge. Later in life, you’ll hear them say, “You know, I should have done that years \\nago, but I just never got around to doing it.” \\nI once asked a man I had met, “If you had all the money in the world, where \\nwould you travel?” \\nHe replied, “I would fly to California to visit my sister. I haven’t seen her in \\nfourteen years, and I would love to see her, especially before her children get any \\nolder. That would be my dream vacation.”\\nAt the time, that trip would have cost him about $500. I pointed that out, and \\nasked why he had not yet taken the trip. He told me, “Oh, I will, I’m just too busy \\nright now.” In other words, this was the “dream vacation” that he would rather \\ndream about taking than actually wake up and take.\\nMy rich dad told me that these dreamers are often the most dangerous. \\n“They live like turtles,” he said, “tucked away in their own quiet, padded room. \\nIf you knock on the shell and peek in, they might lunge out and bite you.” \\nThe lesson: Let dreaming turtles dream. Most aren’t going anywhere, and that \\nseems to be just fine with them.\\nThose Who Achieve a Dream, and Then Live Bored \\nA friend of mine once said to me, “Twenty years ago, I dreamed of becoming a \\ndoctor. So I became a doctor. And I enjoy being a doctor, but now I’m bored with \\nlife. Something is missing.”\\nBoredom usually is a sign that it’s time for a new dream.

These people say, “I’ve just had a \\nmajor breakthrough. Let me tell you about my new plan.” Or, “This time things will \\nbe different.” Or, “I’m turning over a new leaf.” Or, “I’m going to work harder, pay \\noff my bills, and invest.” Or, “I just heard of a new company coming to town, and it \\nis looking for someone with my qualifications. This could be my big break.”\\nMy rich dad said, “People like this often try to achieve a lot, but they try to do it \\non their own. But very few people achieve their dreams on their own. These people \\nshould keep dreaming big, make a plan, and then find a team that will help them \\nmake their dreams come true.”\\nThose Who Dream Big, Achieve Those Dreams, and Go On \\nto Dream Even Bigger Dreams!\\nI think that most of us would like to be this kind of person. I know I would. \\nWouldn’t you?\\nMy rich dad said it this way: “Big people have big dreams and small people \\nhave small dreams. If you want to change who you are, begin by changing the size \\nof your  dream.” \\nAs you know, I’ve been broke—totally, flat-out broke, living in my car with my \\nbride. I know what it’s like. But broke  is a temporary condition. Poor is different. \\nPoor is a state of mind. You can be broke and still be rich in spirit, rich in ambition, \\nrich in courage, rich in determination. It costs nothing to dream big, and it costs not \\none cent more to dream huge. No matter how broke you might be, the only way you \\nwill become poor is by giving up on your dreams.\\nThe unique thing about the network marketing lifestyle is that you don’t frame \\nyour dreams as something you reach only after forty years, or only for a few weeks \\nout of the calendar, or only on Sunday afternoons. When you start building your \\nnetwork marketing business, you start living your dreams, albeit in small ways at \\nfirst, from Day One.\\nIt is a shift in mindset, from “I can’t” to “I can”; from being at the mercy of \\ncircumstance to being at the helm of your life; from being enslaved to being free.\\nIn his conclusion to Walden , his meditation on the self-determined life, \\nThoreau wrote:\\nI learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the \\ndirection of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will \\nmeet with a success unexpected in common hours.\\nI couldn’t have said it better myself.'),\n",

According to the Direct Selling Association, of the fifteen \\nmillion people in the United States who are in network marketing, about 88 percent \\nare female. And while they do not provide a breakdown by gender of the more than \\nsixty-two million people in the business worldwide, the proportions on a global scale \\nare probably close to the same as in the States.\\nWhy? Historically, one reason is that many households have started their \\nnetwork marketing businesses as part-time ventures, and for families where the man The supporting, coaching, nurturing relationship of a \\nnetwork marketing sponsor to her growing network of \\napprentice networkers is the kind of relationship and \\ninteraction in which women excel.'),\n",

As Robert has explained, \\nit’s not a business that revolves around making sales; it is a business that revolves around \\nmaking connections . It’s about establishing relationships, coaching and training, and \\nteaching and mentoring. The actual day-to-day work of building a network is less like \\ncarving out a sales territory than it is like building a community.\\nAnd the supporting, coaching, nurturing relationship of a network marketing \\nsponsor to her growing network of apprentice networkers is the kind of relationship \\nand interaction in which women excel.\\nOf course, none of this means that men can’t be successful in network marketing, \\ntoo. There are millions of men who are proving that every day. But the bottom line \\nof the business is simply this: It is a business model where women excel.\\nWhat Women Need\\nAnd it’s a good thing, too, because today’s women really need to learn how to \\nbuild their own wealth.\\nA young journalist approached me a few years ago and said, with obvious \\npassion, “We have to make women aware that they have to take charge of their \\nmoney. They cannot depend on someone else to do that for them!” \\nAs we talked together, I soon learned where her passion was coming from. \\nIt turned out her 54-year-old mother had recently moved in with her after going \\nthrough a divorce that had left her with basically nothing. She was now supporting \\nher mother as well as herself. \\nThat was enough of a wake-up call in itself, but what had really shaken her up \\nwas when she took a close look at her finances to see what resources she had to support \\nthe two of them. She realized that if her steady paycheck were for any reason to stop \\nsuddenly, the only thing she had to fall back on was about $7,000 in  savings. \\nFor a household of two, $7,000 wouldn’t go very far. She and her mom were \\nboth a few thin paychecks away from poverty and even homelessness. No wonder she \\nwas passionate about the subject of women taking control of their finances!\\nFortunately for me, I am not in this young woman’s position. Robert and I are \\nfinancially set for the rest of our lives, regardless of what the economy does. \\nBut even though I don’t have that sword hanging over my head, I am just as \\npassionately driven as this young woman was on the subject of women creating their \\nown financial independence.\\nThe “how-to’s” of network marketing are no different for women as they are \\nfor men.

Here are six reasons why women need to get into \\nthis game called wealth-building. \\n1) The Statistics\\nThe statistics about women and money are startling. The following are U.S. \\nstatistics, yet for other countries throughout the world, the statistics are very similar \\nor are trending in the same direction. \\nIn the United States:\\nt\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x15\\x18\\x01QFSDFOU\\x01PG\\x01XPNFO\\x01PWFS\\x01UIF\\x01BHF\\x01PG\\x01\\x16\\x11\\x01BSF\\x01TJOHMF\\x1c\\x01JO\\x01PUIFS\\x01XPSET\\r\\x01UIFZ\\x01BSF\\x01\\nfinancially responsible for themselves.\\nt\\x01\\x01\\x018PNFO\\x08T\\x01SFUJSFNFOU \\x01JODPNF\\x01JT\\x01MFTT\\x01UIBO\\x01UIBU\\x01PG\\x01NFO\\x01CFDBVTF\\x01BT\\x01UIF\\x01QSJNBSZ\\x01\\ncaretaker for the home, a woman is away from the work force an average \\nof 14.7 years, as compared to 1.6 years for men.

That more and more women are not educated \\nor prepared to take care of themselves financially, especially as they grow older. \\nWe’ve spent our entire lives taking care of our families, but have no ability to care \\nfor ourselves in this vital way. \\n2)  Avoiding Dependency \\nYou don’t get into a marriage expecting a divorce. You don’t begin a new job \\nexpecting to be laid off. But it happens, and today with more and more frequency. \\nWomen, if you are depending on a husband, a boss, or anyone else for your financial \\nfuture, think twice. They may simply not be there. Too often, we may not even realize \\njust how dependent we are until we’re faced with our own personal wake-up call. \\n3) No Glass Ceiling \\nAlong with all the challenges facing the corporate employee in this post-2008 \\nworld, women still face one additional, huge obstacle: the infamous “glass ceiling.” '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='CHAPTER  17:  A Business Where Women Excel\\n90Yes, it’s true, even today: Because of our gender, women can move only so far up \\nthe corporate ladder. And for women 50 or older, trying to re-enter the world of \\ncorporate employment? You don’t even want to know.\\nIn the world of network marketing, the very idea of a glass ceiling for women is \\nludicrous. Your network marketing company doesn’t care if you’re female or male, \\nblack or white, a college grad or a high-school dropout. It only cares about how \\ndiligently and effectively you build your network—and as I pointed out, there are \\nfour times as many women as there are men doing exactly that. \\nThe key is your skills, education, and experience. There are no limits and no \\nceilings, glass or otherwise, for women in the world of network marketing. \\n4) No Limits on Income\\nBecause of the glass ceiling and the still-present wage inequality between men and \\nwomen in the job market, a woman is often limited in the amount of income she can \\nmake. Studies show that women with the same education and experience as their male \\ncounterparts earn about seventy-four cents for every dollar their male peers earn. \\nBut a network marketing business is fully scalable . Regardless of gender, in \\nnetwork marketing, the size of the income stream you can generate by building your \\nnetwork is without limit.\\n5) Increased Self-Esteem\\nPersonally, I think this is one of the greatest benefits and rewards to a network \\nmarketing business—and it is one of the strongest reasons women become involved in the \\nbusiness. It’s not unusual for a woman’s self-esteem to be linked to her ability to provide \\nfor herself. Being dependent on anyone for your financial life can lead to a reduced sense \\nof self-worth. You may do things you otherwise would not do if money were no issue. \\nI’ve seen women’s self-esteem soar once they know how to make it on their own \\nfinancially. And when a woman’s self-esteem rises, the relationships around her tend \\nto improve. Higher self-esteem leads to greater success, which ultimately leads to the \\ngreatest gift of all—freedom. \\n6) Control of Your Time \\nWhen it comes to devoting energy to building genuine wealth, one major \\nimpediment women often have far more than men is the simple matter of time. This \\nis especially true for mothers who spend many hours taking care of children. I hear \\nfrom many women, “After I come home from work, I have to get dinner ready, help \\nmy kids with their homework, and clean up the dishes. By the time everyone’s in bed \\nand I have a free moment to myself, I’m exhausted!” \\nAs a network marketer, you are in control of your time. This business is something \\nyou can do part time or full time. It is something you can do from your home, on the \\nphone and computer, in the evenings, weekends, anytime, anywhere. It is a business '),\n",

The statistics prove how much times have changed for women and \\npoint out that our need for real-life financial education is no longer a luxury; it’s a \\nnecessity. Depending on someone else for your financial future is like rolling the dice. \\nThe reward may be there in the end, but the risk is steep. \\nGlass ceilings and limits to income are what so many women have been fighting \\nagainst for ages. Both disappear in the world of network marketing. And then two \\nof the greatest gifts of all—a higher sense of self-worth and time to spend exactly as \\nyou want—can be yours. \\nHowever, out of all these reasons I’ve just listed, I have no way of knowing \\nwhich speaks the most to you. You are not the “average woman”; you are you. And \\nthe single most compelling reason for building your network marketing business is \\none that only you can determine.\\nCreate Your Wealth ... and Have Fun Doing It\\nRegardless of what that compelling reason is, you have to remember one more \\nthing when starting a network marketing business, and that is to have fun . \\nYes, it’s great to think that you can earn an extra $100, $1,000, or even $10,000 \\na month, and that you can avoid dependency and have control of your time, but if \\nyou are not having fun, it can quickly lead to that same rut many find themselves in \\nout in the corporate world. Simply put, you have to be passionate about what you \\ndo; the lack of it will reflect in your bank account.\\nThat’s why I think party plan  businesses—a type of network marketing business \\nthat revolves around in-home parties—are ideal for so many woman looking to \\nstart their own businesses. Party plan businesses are the perfect opportunity to \\nspend time with family and friends in the comfort of your own home even while \\nyou are creating a social network that will allow you to build wealth—and have \\nfun doing it. \\nAn interesting fact about the party planning sector is that during turbulent \\neconomic times, it continues to fare well. In fact, this is one reason the network \\nmarketing industry as a whole is such a force to be reckoned with. Companies such as \\nVorwerk (J AFRA  Cosmetics), Mary Kay, Tupperware, Scentsy, Partylite, Stampin’ \\nUp, Jewels by Park Lane, the Longaberger Company, and Southern Living at Home \\nare among sixty-four direct selling companies with an annual global wholesale \\nrevenue of $100 million or more.\\nAccording to a September 2009 Direct Selling News  report, Tastefully Simple, a \\nparty plan company offering specialty food items, saw sales rise by 5 percent in 2008, \\ndespite the recession. Another, Pampered Chef (which was purchased by billionaire '),\n",

Party plan companies offer a low-risk, highly \\nrewarding opportunity for any woman looking to take charge of her financial \\nfuture. I recommend it for stay-at-home moms looking to join the ranks of new \\nentrepreneurs, working women looking to supplement their paychecks, college \\nstudents hoping to earn a few extra dollars—any woman who wants to give herself \\nthe opportunity to create wealth ... and have fun doing it.\\nKnow What’s Important\\nOn our very first date, Robert asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I told \\nhim I wanted to run my own business someday. He said, “I can help you with that.” \\nWithin a month, we had a business going together.\\nBut he also started talking to me about larger things, too—about spirituality, \\nand asking me about my life’s purpose. This was in the 1980s, when people were \\nworkaholics and proud of it. By the ’90s, people began taking a closer look at their \\nlives and asking some harder questions. But it was really after 9/11 that people started \\nsaying, “Whoa, wait a minute. Why am I running around like a hamster on a wheel? \\nWhat am I doing with my life? Where is it all going?”\\nI hear women all the time say they are too busy to get involved in a part-time \\nhome-based business. I tell them, “Here’s the key to making your business successful: \\nYou have to look at your life, really look at it, and ask yourself, ‘What is it that is so \\nmeaningful to me that I have to have it in my life?’ ”\\nWhat is important enough to you that you’ll make the time and devote the effort \\nto building a business that generates its own income, and then use that income to \\nbuild wealth that will take care of you for the rest of your life? Because if you don’t \\nidentify what that is, it’s just not going to happen.\\nFreedom is different for everyone; success is different for everyone. It’s personal, \\nand it should  be personal. Numbers are abstract; whether it’s five thousand dollars or \\none million dollars, it doesn’t really mean anything until you give it the meaning it \\nhas in your own life.\\nEarly in our marriage, Robert and I were both passionately committed to being \\nin business for ourselves, to not having other people tell us what to do, and to being \\nin control of our own financial destinies. That was so important to us that we were \\nwilling to put up with just about any hardship to make it happen.\\nAnd it took years—really, about ten years.\\nAt times, the stress of having no income was enormous. We had all sorts of \\nfriends who were telling us we were crazy, that we should just go get regular jobs with \\nregular paychecks, but that was what we absolutely did not want to do.\\nFinally we decided we had to do something. Robert began teaching some \\ncourses. I went to a friend who had a clothing line and asked her to let me market her \\nclothes. I went to hair salons and set up little mini-boutiques.

Now you face a choice. There are several thousand network marketing \\ncompanies in operation. Which one are you going to join? And how do you choose?\\nNewcomers to network marketing often make this choice by default, by simply \\nsigning up with the first opportunity to come along. Now, it may well be that the \\nfirst company you hear about is a great company, and a wise choice for you. But it \\nshould be an informed, educated choice that you make with care. This is your future \\nwe’re talking about.\\nSo how do you choose? On what criteria do you base your decision?\\n“Our company has the best compensation plan—you can make great money  here!” \\nWhen I was investigating different network marketing companies, I often heard \\nthis comment. The people anxious to show me their business opportunity would tell \\nme stories of people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month from their \\nbusiness. Because I have met people who really do make hundreds of thousands of \\ndollars a month from their network marketing business, I don’t doubt its massive \\nearning potential. \\nYet I do not recommend looking into a network marketing business primarily \\nfor the money. \\n“We have the best, most premium-quality products—products that have \\nchanged people’s lives!” \\nI heard this a lot, too. Profound product benefits were probably the No. 2 reason \\nfor joining that people gave me, money being No. 1. And again, I didn’t doubt it. \\nWhile I heard plenty of exaggeration and outright hype, I also found truly great \\nproducts, some of which I still consume or use today. In fact, exceptionally high-\\nquality products tend to be one of the hallmarks of network marketing.\\nYet products are also not the most important benefit. \\nLet me repeat that:\\nWhen choosing a company to work with, the product is not the most \\nimportant  consideration.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 110}, page_content='CHAPTER  18:  Choose Wisely\\n98I stress this because most people assume that the product is the most important \\nthing. It’s not. Remember, you’re not taking a job as a salesperson; you’re going \\ninto business for yourself, and the business you are in is network-building . And when \\nyou start looking around at different companies, the question foremost in your \\nmind needs to be, “Is this company going to help me learn how to become a master \\nnetwork-builder?”\\nThe No. 1 reason I recommend network marketing is for its system of real-world \\nbusiness education and personal development. \\nA network marketing system is set up to make it possible for anyone to share in \\nthe wealth. It is open to anyone who has drive, determination, and perseverance. It \\ndoes not care what your family name is or what college you went to (or if you went \\nto one at all), how much money you make today, what race or sex you are, how good-\\nlooking you are, how popular you are, or even how smart you are. \\nMost network marketing companies care primarily about how much you are \\nwilling to learn, to change, and to grow, and whether you have the guts to stick it \\nout through thick and thin while you learn to be a business owner.\\nIs this true of every single network marketing company out there? No. As \\nin anything, there are the good, the bad, and the ugly—and there are also the \\ntruly great. \\nNot all network marketing companies really support education. There are some \\nthat are just about hustle: They just want you to go sell for them, and don’t really care \\nabout teaching you anything. They just want you to bring your friends and family \\ninto the fold. If you run into one of those companies, I would be leery about getting \\ninvolved: They won’t contribute to your growth and may not be around long. \\nBut the better companies out there will be totally dedicated to your business \\neducation. They are committed to the long haul and place a priority on developing \\nyour skills and your abilities. When you find a company like that, with leaders above \\nyou who are willing to train you and help you become the businessperson you can \\nbe, that’s a company to stay with. \\nIs the compensation plan important? Sure. Is the quality of the product line \\ncritical? Of course. But far more than those things, what I really look at is how \\ndedicated the company is to developing you as a strong B quadrant individual—a \\ngenuine wealth-building businessperson. That’s the most important thing about the \\nnetwork marketing company you affiliate with: It really is your business school.\\nIf you like what you hear from the initial presentation, \\ntake some time to actually meet the people who do  \\nthe educating and training. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content='The Business of the 21st Century\\n99Invest the time to look past the compensation and products and really peer into \\nthe heart of the company: Is it truly interested in training and educating you? This \\ntakes more time than just listening to a thirty-minute sales pitch, clicking through a \\ncolorful Web site, and hearing about how much money people are making. To find \\nout how good a company’s education really is may require you to get off your couch \\nand look into its training, educational seminars, and events. \\nIf you like what you hear from the initial presentation, take some time to actually \\nmeet the people who do the educating and training. \\nAnd look carefully, because many network marketing companies say they have \\ngreat educational plans, but not all do. In some companies I looked into, the only \\ntraining they had was a recommended book list, and then they focused on training \\nyou to recruit your friends and family into the business. \\nSo take your time and look carefully, because there are quite a few network \\nmarketing companies that do have excellent educational and training plans—in fact, \\nsome of the best real-life business training I’ve seen anywhere. \\nHere are a few questions to ask yourself about a network marketing company.\\nt\\x01\\x018IP\\x08T\\x01SVOOJOH\\x01UIF\\x01TIJQ \\nt\\x01\\x01%PFT\\x01UIF\\x01DPNQBOZ\\x01PGGFS\\x01B\\x01QSPWFO\\x01QMBO\\x01PG\\x01BDUJPO \\nt\\x01\\x01\\x01%PFT\\x01UIF\\x01DPNQBOZ\\x01FNCSBDF\\x01CPUI\\x01CVTJOFTT\\x01TLJMMT\\x01BOE\\x01QFSTPOBM\\x01EFWFMPQNFOU \\x01BT\\x01\\na regular part of its educational and training programs?\\nt\\x01\\x01\\x01%PFT\\x01UIF\\x01DPNQBOZ\\x01IBWF\\x01B\\x01TUSPOH\\r\\x01IJHI\\x0eRVBMJUZ\\r \\x01BOE\\x01IJHIMZ\\x01NBSLFUBCMF \\x01QSPEVDU\\x01\\nline that you can be passionate about?\\nWho’s Running the Ship?\\nInexperienced people, who approach a new business with an E quadrant or S \\nquadrant perspective, often look at a company’s products, pay plan, or promotion \\nto judge the strength of the company. I skip over all that and look directly at the \\nprincipals —the people at the helm.\\nIt’s not that the product and pay plan and everything else aren’t important. \\nBut no company is perfect. Problems always happen. If you have the right people \\nrunning the ship, then whatever goes wrong, they’ll fix it. In fact, if you have great \\npeople running the company, there’s no problem they can’t fix. But if you have the \\nwrong people at the helm, then when problems happen, there’s absolutely nothing \\nyou can do about it.\\nYou can’t judge a book by its cover; look beyond the promotional videos and \\nWeb sites. Look at the principals. What are their backgrounds, their experience, their \\ntrack records, their character? Whether or not you get to know them personally or ever \\nwork with them directly, they are the partners you’re getting into business with.\\nJohn:  One thing I’d like to address here is the myth that eager promoters \\nsometimes spread: that in order to make “the big money,” you have to “get in \\non the ground floor.” This is just not true.'),\n",

Why would you want to risk your hard work, \\ntime, and energy by investing all that in a company that doesn’t yet have a \\ntrack  record?\\nJohn:  There are strong, viable, excellent network marketing companies that \\nare 3 years old, and there are those that are 30 years old. It’s true that there is \\nsomething exciting and invigorating about being part of something that is still \\nyoung and in its fresh beginnings. But there is also a lot of power and credibility \\nthat comes with being affiliated with a company that has been in business \\nfor decades.\\nI would exercise due caution about committing yourself to a company that \\nhas barely opened its doors. Yet, even here, there are exceptions; you may find a \\nnew company that is just starting out, yet has such strong corporate credentials \\nthat it merits serious consideration. \\nThe point here is, do your due diligence: Find out what it is you’re looking at \\nand who you’re getting into business with. \\nDon’t be fooled by people telling you that the trick to getting rich is being with \\na brand-new company, or a 5-year-old company, or a 35-year-old company. There is \\nno “trick.” There is no magic formula. What you want is a company that knows what \\nit’s doing and gives you clear signs that it’s going to be there for the long haul.\\nDoes the Company Offer a Proven Plan of Action? \\nJohn:  The most lucrative and viable network marketing opportunities will not \\nexpect you to reinvent the wheel. Instead, they will offer plans of action to help \\nyou create the success you’re after. For example, they will have a training guide \\nwith suggested daily or weekly activities.\\nSome companies will offer business owners a personalized Web site to help \\neducate prospects or share products and opportunities. First-class, professional \\npresentation tools such as CDs, DVDs, podcasts, and print materials have \\nbecome standard fare for the typical network marketer’s toolbox.\\nDoes the Company Embrace Both Business Skills and \\nPersonal Development as a Regular Part of Its Educational \\nand Training Programs?\\nI’ve made it pretty clear that I hold the training and education you get as the \\nNo. 1 value in your network marketing experience, even more than the income \\nstream you’re building.

Books never go out of style!\\nJohn:  And live events, too. Even in the Internet age, there is something powerful \\nabout being physically present at a live event, something that no other medium \\ncan fully replace. \\nThese days, the day-to-day business of building a network is typically \\nconducted over the phone and the Internet as much as it is face to face. But \\nyou’ll still find that the better companies put a strong focus on their annual, \\nsemiannual, quarterly, and/or monthly events. Why? For their educational, \\ntraining, and personal-development value.\\nAnd by the way, it’s not just the network marketing corporation itself who \\nwill be involved in your training and education. You have a whole hierarchy \\nof people—from the person who actually enrolls you directly into the business \\n(often termed your “sponsor”) through their sponsor and all the way up the \\nchain of sponsorship (your “upline”), all the way to the corporate officers \\nthemselves—and they all have a vested interested in seeing you grow, learn, \\nand succeed.\\nOne of the beauties of the network marketing system is that it is set up to be \\nthe exact opposite of the dog-eat-dog corporate environment, where even your best \\nfriend may climb over you to get to the next rung on the ladder.\\nIn network marketing, that kind of cutthroat competition doesn’t happen, \\nsimply because your sponsor’s and upline’s success depends on your success.

Why? Because of one word: buzz. \\nNetwork marketing companies typically don’t do a lot of mass-media advertising. \\nYou don’t often see billboards or TV ads for these products. Why not? Because they \\nuse a completely different promotional model. Instead of putting their advertising \\nbudgets into expensive mass media, they put their advertising budget into people \\nlike you.\\nJohn: The lifeblood of a growing network is word-of-mouth—individual people \\ntelling other people about their product or service and the opportunity they have \\nbecome a part of.

The strategies that work best in networking \\nare those that duplicate  best. Network marketing does for a B quadrant business \\nmodel what Henry Ford did for the automobile industry: It reduces the process to \\ncomponent parts that can be mass-produced. \\nJohn: A successful network marketing business is not a handcrafted masterpiece \\nmade by one skilled pair of hands. It’s a symphony of simplicity crafted by \\nhundreds of thousands of hands.\\nYou Don’t Have to Be “Great at Sales”\\nAgain, one of the biggest misconceptions that people who are not actually in \\nnetwork marketing often have about the business is that you need to be a “born \\nsalesman” to be successful here. \\nNothing could be further from the truth. In fact, holding onto that idea will hurt you in \\nnetwork marketing. Why? Because “great salesman” types cannot duplicate themselves. \\nJohn:  Remember, this is not principally a sales business, but a teaching, team-\\nbuilding, and leadership business. Your job is not to sell a lot of product, and it \\nisn’t even to teach a lot of people to sell a lot of product. It’s to lead, train, and \\nbuild people. It is first and foremost to build a network.\\nRobert:  Making the sale  is not the point; building the network  is the point.\\nJohn:  Exactly.'),\n",

For \\none thing, building your own business is not like starting a new job, where you start \\nearning a paycheck the moment you show up for work. It’s going to take time to \\nbuild your network. Give it time. \\nJohn:  And not only for financial reasons. Even if you could afford to quit your \\njob, many new networkers find that once they get their businesses going, being \\nconnected to their co-workers can serve as a source for prospective partners or \\nreferrals to prospective partners.\\nThe great majority of network marketers build their businesses part-time. The \\n2008 National Salesforce Survey conducted by the Direct Selling Association showed \\nthat only about one in eight network marketers worked twenty hours or more per \\nweek on their business.\\nYou Don’t Need to Be Rich or Take out a  \\nSecond Mortgage on Your Home \\nMost network marketing businesses require less than $500 in actual out-of-\\npocket startup costs. Make no mistake about it: What you save in cash capital you \\nwill make up for in sweat equity and passion. The major investment in most self-\\nowned businesses is investment of oneself , in the form of time, focus, and persistence. \\nBut you don’t need a pile of cash to start.\\nJohn:  Still, just because the capital investment is low does not mean it’s \\nnonexistent. This is a business, and you need to run it like a business. And that \\nmeans you will have monthly operating costs. \\nTypically, your monthly budget will be very modest: a monthly supply \\nof the product sampling, and the cost of contact and presentation tools, such \\nas those mentioned above (CDs, DVDs, Web sites, etc.), as well as ongoing \\nbusiness-development and personal-development materials. \\nSo, no, you don’t need a big cash stake to start, but you do need to budget \\nsome reasonable monthly expenditures.\\nYou Don’t Need to Be a Genius at Negotiation  \\nor a Whiz at Numbers\\nYou do need a burning desire and determination fueled by a strong dose of passion.\\n“You have to love what you do,” says my friend Donald Trump. “Without \\npassion, great success is hard to come by. As an entrepreneur, you’ll have tough times \\nif you aren’t passionate about what you’re doing.”\\nThose are a few of the things it doesn’t  take to build a successful network \\nmarketing business.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 117}, page_content='The Business of the 21st Century\\n105It Takes Being Honest with Yourself\\nBuilding a B quadrant business is not an easy task. You need to ask yourself, “Do \\nI have what it takes? Am I willing to go beyond my comfort zone? Am I willing to \\nbe led as well as to learn to lead? Is there a rich person inside of me, ready to come \\nout?” If the answer is “Yes,” then start looking for a network marketing business that \\nhas a great training program. \\nJohn: I would also add this: Make sure you are clear on where you are and what \\nyou would like to accomplish in your life. Having a vision for what you would \\nlike to accomplish is essential. \\nThen, get clear on your expectations. Get clear on what it will take, in terms \\nof time put in each week, as well as money, skills, and resources. Get clear on \\nwhat actions you’ll need to take to make this business successful. Get clear on a \\nrealistic time frame.\\nIn the book I wrote with Donald Trump, Why We Want You to Be Rich , \\nDonald  wrote: \\n“Network marketing requires an entrepreneurial spirit, and that means focus and \\nperseverance. I do not recommend network marketing to people who are not highly \\nself-motivated.”\\nDonald is absolutely right.\\nIt Takes the Right Attitude\\nFor me, becoming an entrepreneur is an ongoing process, one that I am still \\ninvolved in. I believe I will be an entrepreneur-in-training till the end. I love business, \\nand I love solving business problems. It is a process that brings me the kind of life I \\nwant. So, although the process has been tough for me at times, it has been worth it. \\nOne thought has kept me going; it was my glow in the dark, even in the darkest \\nof hours. I had a small piece of paper from a Chinese fortune cookie taped to the base \\nof an office phone at our surfer wallet company that read: \\nYou can always quit. Why start now? \\nThere were many phone calls that I had to handle that provided me with more \\nthan enough reasons to quit. Yet, after hanging up the phone, I would glance at the \\nwords of wisdom from the fortune cookie and say to myself, “As much as I want to \\nquit, I won’t quit today. I’ll quit tomorrow.” \\nThe good thing is, tomorrow never came.\\nMy rich dad used to say if getting rich were easy, everybody would be rich. \\nThat’s why, when people ask what was the No. 1 thing that allowed me to become \\nrich, I say that I didn’t want anybody to tell me what to do. I wanted my freedom \\nso badly. I didn’t want job security. I wanted financial freedom. And that’s what \\nnetwork marketing offers.'),\n",

But that doesn’t \\nnecessarily mean it will be. That’s up to you.\\nNetwork marketing is the perfect vehicle for people who want to enter the world \\nof the B quadrant. While your income potential in the E and S quadrants is typically \\nlimited to how much you as an individual  can produce, in a network marketing \\nbusiness, you can earn as much as your network generates. That means, once you \\nbuild a very large network, you can earn a massive amount of money.\\nHowever, simply joining a network marketing company does not make your \\nnew venture a B quadrant business—not until it’s truly large.\\nJohn:  The technical definition of a “big business” is one that encompasses 500 \\nor more people. Again, those 500 are usually described as “employees,” but \\nthe point is the numbers involved. When you build a network of 500 or more \\nindependent representatives, what you have definitely fits the definition of a big, \\nor B quadrant, business. And a network marketing business system is designed \\nto expand to well over 500 people. It’s common for an individual’s network \\norganization to grow to several thousand or even tens of thousands, and it is not \\nunusual to see network organizations of hundreds  of thousands.\\nNewcomers to the networking business often make the mistake of treating \\ntheir fledgling network’s income as “free money”—readily disposable income \\nfrom Day One. But when you have just 5, 10, 50, or even 100 or 200 people in \\nyour network, your new business is still very much in the formative period. It is \\nnot yet a big business.\\nOnce your network grows beyond 500 people and is getting into the thousands, \\nyou have a true B quadrant business that is generating passive income. It is not only \\na viable network; it is an income-generating asset. \\nBut this means that the interval from when you join your company up to the \\npoint that you reach that 500-plus scale of business is a formative period, a time \\nof laying your foundation. Keep it in perspective. Keep your eye on the real goal: \\nwealth-building.\\nIt Takes Time\\nIf you have the idea that you can start a network marketing business and expect \\nto start making money right away, then you are still thinking like someone who lives \\nin the E or S quadrants. In fact, it is people in the E and S quadrants who are most \\noften sucked into the get-rich-quick schemes and scams of life. '),\n",

When \\nthey were still just another unknown British band of wannabes, the Beatles played \\na nightclub in Hamburg, seven hours a day, seven days a week—and put in about \\n10,000 hours. \\n“What’s really interesting about this 10,000-hour rule,” says Gladwell, “is that it \\napplies virtually everywhere. You can’t become a chess grandmaster unless you spend \\n10,000 hours on practice. The tennis prodigy who starts playing at 6 is playing in \\nWimbledon at 16 or 17 [like] Boris Becker. The classical musician who starts playing \\nthe violin at 4 is debuting at Carnegie Hall at 15 or so.”\\nTen thousand hours: Do the math. If you work eight hours a day, five days a \\nweek, you hit the 10,000-hour mark after five years  of full-time effort.\\nFortunately for you, mastering network marketing is not like becoming a chess \\ngrandmaster. You don’t need to become Boris Becker, the Beatles, or Bill Gates. You \\ndon’t need to become the best in the world—but you do have to master the skills of \\nthe business. It won’t take you five years of full-time, forty-hour weeks. But to learn \\nand master what it takes to build a massive network with passive income, do yourself \\na favor and give yourself enough time. \\nBy the way, I still use this five-year plan.\\nWhen I decide to learn something new—for example, investing in real estate—I \\nstill allow myself five years to learn the process. When I wanted to learn how to invest \\nin stocks, I again gave myself five years to learn the process. Many people invest once, \\nlose a few dollars, and then quit. They quit after their first mistake, which is why \\nthey fail to learn. But losing is part of the process of winning. It’s only losers who \\nthink that winners never lose, who think that mistakes must be avoided at all costs. \\nMistakes are priceless opportunities to learn essential lessons. \\nToday, I still give myself five years to make as many mistakes as possible.

If I make no mistakes for five years, then I am no smarter than I was five \\nyears ago—just five years older.\\nGive Yourself Time to Unlearn , Too\\nAs much learning as you’ll do in this business, chances are good there is also a \\nsubstantial amount of unlearning  that needs to happen. \\nOne reason so many people get so entrenched in the E and S quadrants is that \\nthey start to feel comfortable there. It isn’t that these quadrants are inherently more \\ncomfortable. After all, you’re being taxed like crazy, your time is never your own, \\nyou’re often forced to work with people you can’t stand … in so many ways these \\nquadrants are really quite uncomfortable . But people start to feel comfortable there \\nbecause they have spent years learning how to be there, and it’s what they know. \\nThat all changes when you enter the world of network marketing. The job \\nexperience that comes from time spent in traditional employment or self-employment \\nis often not that useful in network marketing. Fixed work hours, set wages or salaries \\nbased on time put in, the structure of having bosses and management hierarchies, \\nnarrowly defined job descriptions, a clearly defined clientele, a clearly defined \\nterritory and physical plant—so many of the trappings of the conventional workplace \\nsimply don’t exist in this business.\\nIf you have worked in traditional sales, as we said before, you’ll actually want to \\nunlearn those skills to a good degree, because in network marketing, it’s not what \\nyou can do that counts, it’s what you can do and duplicate .\\nIf you have experience managing employees, you’ll need to do some unlearning \\nthere, too—because in network marketing, you don’t hire, fire, or tell people what to \\ndo. It’s an entirely new dynamic, this business of the 21st century, and to excel here, \\nyou will likely need to leave some old habits behind.\\nTake your time to unlearn as well as to learn. For some people, the hardest part \\nof switching from the left side of the quadrant to the right side of the quadrant is to \\nunlearn the point of view of the E and S quadrants. Once you have unlearned what \\nyou had learned, the change will go much faster and easier. \\nIt All Comes Down to Action\\nYou can plan all you want, study all you want, and learn all you want, but the \\nonly people who win in network marketing are people who take action—today, \\ntomorrow, and every day.'),\n",

Most people would answer, “Money, of course!” And \\nthey would be wrong. Having money does not make you rich, because you can \\nalways lose money. Owning real estate does not make you truly rich, because (as we \\nhave seen dramatically in the last few years) real estate can always lose value.\\nSo what makes you rich? Knowledge .\\nMy Golden Lesson\\nAs a young adult, even before I began investing in real estate, my very \\nfirst investment was in gold. “Gold is the only true money,” I reasoned. \\n“How could I go wrong?” I began buying gold coins in 1972, when gold was \\napproximately $85 an ounce. I was 25 years old. By the time I was 32, gold \\nwas approaching $800 an ounce, and my money had multiplied nearly tenfold . \\nHot dog! \\nThe frenzy was on, and greed overtook caution. Rumors were that gold was \\ngoing to hit $2,500 an ounce. Greedy investors began piling on, even those who \\nhad never bought gold before. I could have sold my gold coins for a significant \\nprofit, but I hung on, hoping for gold to go higher. About a year later, with gold \\nsagging back below $500 an ounce, I finally sold my last coin. I watched gold drift \\nlower and lower until 1996, when it finally bottomed at $275 in 1996.\\nI didn’t make much money with it, but gold taught me a priceless lesson about \\nmoney. Once I saw that I could actually lose money investing in “real money,” It is not real estate, gold, stocks, hard work, or money that \\nmakes you rich; it is what you know  about real estate, gold, \\nstocks, hard work, and money that makes you rich. Ultimately, \\nit is your financial intelligence  that makes you rich.'),\n",

It was information  \\nrelative to the asset that ultimately made a person rich or poor. \\nIt is not real estate, gold, stocks, hard work, or money that makes you rich; \\nit is what you know  about real estate, gold, stocks, hard work, and money that \\nmakes you rich. Ultimately, it is your financial intelligence  that makes you  rich.\\nFinancial intelligence has little or nothing to do with academic intelligence. \\nYou can be a genius when it comes to academic intelligence, but a moron when it \\ncomes to financial intelligence.\\n1) Knowing How to Make More Money \\nThe more money you make, the higher your financial intelligence. Someone \\nwho earns a $1 million a year has a higher financial IQ than one who earns $30,000 \\na year. \\n2) Knowing How to Protect Your Money \\nThe world is out to take your money, and it’s not just the Bernie Madoffs. One \\nof the biggest financial predators is your government, who takes your money legally .\\nTake two people who both make $1 million a year. If one pays 20 percent in \\ntaxes while the other pays 35 percent, the first person has a higher financial IQ.\\n3) Knowing How to Budget Your Money \\nMany people fail to keep much money out of what they earn, simply because \\nthey budget like a poor person rather than like a rich person. Budgeting your money \\nalso takes financial intelligence. \\nTake two people: Person A earns $120,000 a year, and Person B earns only \\n$60,000 a year. Who has more financial intelligence, Person A? Not so fast. Let’s say \\nPerson A also spends  $120,000 every year, putting him at Square 1 at year’s end. But \\nPerson B, who earns only $60,000, budgets carefully and is able to live well on just \\n$50,000, and invests the remaining $10,000. Who ends up with more?\\nIf you have poor money-management skills, then all the money in the \\nworld cannot save you. If you budget your money wisely, and learn about the B \\nand I quadrants, then you are on the path to great personal fortune and, most \\nimportantly,  freedom.\\nBeing able to live well and still invest no matter how much or how little you make  \\nrequires a high level of financial intelligence. Having a surplus is something you have \\nto actively budget for. \\n4) Knowing How to Leverage Your Money \\nAfter you budget a surplus, the next financial challenge is to leverage that \\nsurplus. Return on investment is yet one more measurement of financial intelligence. '),\n",

And the one who earns 50 percent tax-free  on his money has a \\nmuch higher financial IQ than the one who earns just 5 percent and then pays 35 \\npercent in taxes on that 5 percent return!\\nMost people save their financial surplus, if they have any, by sticking it in a bank \\nor putting it into a mutual fund portfolio, hoping this will leverage their money. \\nBut there are much better ways to leverage your money than savings and mutual \\nfunds. Those don’t require much financial intelligence: You can train a monkey to \\nsave money and invest in mutual funds—which is exactly why the returns on those \\ninvestment vehicles are historically pretty pitiful.\\nA Magnificent Life\\nThe purpose of your network marketing business is not simply to make you \\nmoney, but to give you the skills and financial intelligence so that you will use that \\nadditional money to build genuine wealth. \\nBut even that is not the end goal. The end goal of building that wealth is so that \\nyou can live a magnificent life.\\nFrom my observations of people in many different situations, I would say there \\nare three ways to live. These three ways are driven by three different emotions, and \\nalso correspond closely to three different financial and emotional states:\\nLIVING  IN FEAR\\nI know what it’s like to be broke. I’ve described how, in 1985, in many ways \\nthe worst year of my life, Kim and I were in such dire straits financially that we were \\nliterally homeless and living in our old broken-down Toyota. The feeling of fear \\nduring those days was paralyzing, so intense that it numbed our entire bodies. \\nI knew this feeling: It was the same sense I had as a young child, growing up in \\na family that was broke most of the time. That dark cloud of “not enough money” \\nhung over our family for most of my childhood. Not having enough money to live \\non is a horrible experience, and it hurts in many more ways than financial. It can \\nundermine your self-confidence and sense of self-worth, and sabotage every aspect \\nof your life.\\nLIVING  IN ANGER  AND  FRUSTRATION\\nThe second way of living is living with the emotion of anger or frustration \\nfrom having to get up and go to work, especially when you would rather be doing \\nsomething else. A person who lives with this feeling may be someone who has \\na good job and high pay but cannot afford to stop working. That is where the \\nfrustration comes from. They know if they stop, the world they live in would come \\ncrashing  down. \\nPeople like this may say, “I cannot afford to quit. If I quit, the banks would \\ncome and take everything away.” These people often say, “I can’t wait until my next \\nvacation,” or “Only ten more years to retirement.”'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 126}, page_content='CHAPTER  20:  Living the Life\\n114LIVING  IN JOY, PEACE , AND  CONTENTMENT\\nThe third way of living is to live with the peace of mind of knowing that, \\nregardless of whether you work or not, there is plenty of money coming in. This is \\nthe feeling Kim and I have lived with ever since 1994, when we sold our business \\nand retired. Kim was then 37 and I was 47. Today, many years later, we still work; \\nin fact, we work hard. Why? Because we love what we do. \\nThe feeling of not having  to work, knowing that no matter what we do we’ll have \\nmore than enough money coming in for as long as we live, is an amazingly freeing, \\nexhilarating feeling, allowing us to do what we genuinely love. \\nWe spend our time together, and whether we’re playing golf, traveling around \\nthe world, or putting in long hours in our boardroom, to us, it’s all play and it’s \\nall the stuff of dreams. It’s our life, exactly as we’ve always wanted it to be, and we \\ntreasure every single moment of it.\\nAnts, Grasshoppers, and Human Beings\\nEarlier I mentioned the fable of the ant and the grasshopper. We all grew up \\nwith this idea that there are two ways to live: You can live like the good, modest, \\nindustrious, and frugal ant and sock away crumbs for the future, or, like the \\nirresponsible and spendthrift grasshopper, dance and fiddle away the days without a \\nthought of the future.\\nIn some ways, this image has done us more harm than good. Sure, it’s good to \\nbe responsible and frugal, and to prepare for the future. But look at the ant’s lifestyle! \\nDo you really want to be a cog in a gigantic ant colony, pushing little crumbs of dirt \\naround, day after day, for the rest of your life?\\nLet’s face: We’re not ants, and we’re not grasshoppers, either; we’re human \\nbeings . Is it unreasonable to expect that we should be able to live the full lives which \\nwe humans are capable of living?\\nIf you grasp the basics of wealth; if you manage your money, your time, and your \\nattention with intelligence; if you create big dreams and have the audacity to follow \\nthem; then you can live a life that meets with a success unexpected in common hours.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 127}, page_content='115CHAPTER  21\\nThe Business of the 21st Century\\nOne reason I have such strong respect for network marketing is that it is a \\ngenuine equal-opportunity business. Network marketing casts a very wide net. When \\nyou look closely at the more than sixty million people worldwide who are engaged in \\nthe business, you’ll find people of every color and creed, every age group, and every \\nlevel of background, experience, and skill.\\nThis also makes it the business of the future. In the 21st century, we are realizing \\nas never before that wealth, as I said earlier, is not a zero-sum game. It’s not a \\nquestion of some of us prospering by holding others down. The future of genuine \\nwealth lies in pioneering ways of doing business that elevate the financial well-being \\nof humanity.\\nThose are my personal business values, and network marketing shares those \\nvalues. And championing those values not only feels good—it’s also good business .\\nDemocratic Wealth-Building\\nOne of the principal reasons I have put so much energy into supporting and \\npromoting the network marketing industry is simply this: Its systems are fairer than \\nprevious systems of acquiring wealth. \\nA network marketing system is set up to make it possible for anyone to share in \\nthe wealth. This is a very democratic way of wealth creation. The system is open to \\nanyone who has drive, determination, and perseverance. The system does not really \\ncare what college you went to or whether you went to one at all. It does not care \\nhow much money you are making today, what race or sex you are, how good-looking \\nyou are, who your parents are, or how popular you are. Most network marketing \\ncompanies care primarily about how much you are willing to learn, to change and \\nto grow, and whether you have the guts to stick it out through thick and thin while \\nyou learn to be a business owner.\\nNetwork marketing is more than just a good idea; in many ways, it is the \\nbusiness model of the future. Why? Because the world is finally starting to awaken to \\nthe reality that the Industrial Age is over. '),\n",

Network marketing \\ngives millions of people throughout the world the opportunity to take control of their \\nlives and their financial futures. That is why, even though Old World thinkers persist \\nin not seeing it yet, the network marketing industry will continue to grow.\\nIn the years ahead, I expect to see an explosion in the prevalence, penetration, \\nvisibility, and maturation of leading network marketing companies.\\nEarlier I wrote about how Thomas Edison became rich, not by making a better \\nlight bulb, but by creating the network that supported the light bulb. Edison had a \\nyoung employee named Henry who did something very similar with another new \\ninvention that, at the time, seemed to have no real practical use.\\nLike Edison with the light bulb, young Henry Ford did not invent the \\nautomobile, but he did something radical that forever changed the invention’s \\ndestiny, along with the destiny of millions of people. At the turn of the century, the \\nautomobile was seen as a curiosity, a rich person’s toy. And indeed, they were so \\ninordinately expensive that only the rich could afford to own one. Ford’s radical idea \\nwas to make the automobile available to everyone . \\nBy slashing production costs and adapting the assembly line to mass-produce \\nstandardized inexpensive cars, Ford became the largest automobile producer in the \\nworld. Not only did he make his car affordable, he also paid the highest wages in \\nthe industry and even offered profit-sharing plans, redistributing over $30 million \\nannually to his workers—and $30 million was worth a lot more in the early 1900s \\nthan it is today!\\nFord’s mission statement was to “Democratize the automobile,” and in the \\ncourse of fulfilling that mission, he made himself a very rich man. \\nNetwork marketing is a revolutionary form of business: For the first time in \\nhistory, it is now possible for anyone and everyone to share in the wealth that, until \\nnow, has been reserved only for the chosen few or the lucky. \\nThe business is not without its detractors. And it has had its share of hucksters \\nand flim-flam artists, unethical people trying to make a quick buck. But by its \\nvery nature and design, network marketing is a strikingly fair, democratic, socially \\nresponsible system of generating wealth. \\nDespite what its detractors will tell you, network marketing is not a very good \\nbusiness for greedy people. In fact, the only way you can become rich in network \\nmarketing is by helping others become rich in the process. To me, this is as \\nrevolutionary as Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were in their day. By design, it is \\nthe perfect business for people who like helping other people. By its very nature and design, network marketing  \\nis a strikingly fair, democratic, socially responsible \\nsystem of  generating wealth. '),\n",

But when the goal of personal gain grows out of perspective and \\npeople pursue it at the expense of others, it becomes repugnant. I believe that \\nmost people are inherently generous, and that we gain the greatest satisfaction and \\nfulfillment from our own achievements when they also serve to lift up others, and \\nnot to keep them down. \\nNetwork marketing satisfies this generous impulse. It offers a path to personal \\nsuccess, to building great wealth and creating financial freedom through a process \\nthat operates successfully only through helping our fellow human beings. \\nYou can become rich by being cheap and greedy. You can also become rich by \\nbeing abundant and generous.

We can march for peace, give speeches endorsing peace, \\nform committees to study peace, and promote peace, but it’s going to be impossible \\nto actually create  that peace we talk about unless and until we can begin to bring \\nsubstantially more economic opportunity to many millions of people.\\nAnd as huge a goal as that sounds, that is exactly what network marketing is doing. \\nToday, many network marketing companies are spreading peace through \\neconomic opportunity all over the world. Not only are network marketing \\ncompanies thriving in all the major capitals of the world, but many are also working \\nin developing nations, bringing financial hope to millions of people who live in \\nimpoverished countries. Most traditional corporations can only survive where people \\nare rich and have money to spend. \\nIt is time that people all over the world had an equal opportunity to enjoy a \\nrich and abundant life, rather than spend their lives working hard only to make the \\nrich richer. \\nIt’s time you had that opportunity.\\nWelcome to the 21st century.'),\n",
