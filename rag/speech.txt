Great Speeches - Full Transcripts of My Favorite Inspiring Talks
I gave my first speech in May, 2010.
It was at my hometown public library and  half a dozen people came out. I just kind of stood there and rambled. There were a lot of awkward silences. One guy clapped. 
Since then I’ve given over 500 keynote speeches. I am still getting better. I have a long way to go. One thing I’ve always done is collect speech transcripts and bits of poetry. I study them — inhale them — to see greatness in action. How do they build connection? How do they structure their messages? What’s the science? What’s the art? 
This is a page of my favorite speech transcripts and poetry: 
“What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness” by George Saunders
Mississippi Testimony by Brandon Boulware
“What, to the slave, is the fourth of July?” by Frederick Douglass
